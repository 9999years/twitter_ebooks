@talldarknweirdo the point being that we leave clear 2D fingerprints on accessible objects fairly often.
@talldarknweirdo he is my friend. We've talked about this. He has repeatedly used terms like "such as a beer mug."
@talldarknweirdo that never was part of the requirements. Just that the source material was 2D, not 3D.
@Maclark89 and, as crypto, is a vector of last resort :) the whole bet was originally based on taking a 2D print, the "easy" vector.
@Maclark89 ummmmmm..... no. Definitely, absolutely not. That doesn't even really make sense in the context of a fingerprint scanner.
@Maclark89 it doesn't matter! If the CCC claim is legitimate, then the sensor is hacked according to specification.
@Maclark89 um, well, the *whole point* is that it was specifically marketed to only work for *the real, fleshly finger.*

@eevee yes :(
.@thegrugq everyone qualified to notice that the default algo was one under serious suspicion
However I kinda wonder if we collectively screwed up in not really noticing this and making it a Big Deal sooner (2/2)
I see no rational basis on which RSA can justify keeping it as the DEFAULT after the research published in 2006/2007 (1/2)
@vogon it’s slow, and there are multiple papers attacking it as flawed, so let’s keep it as the default
@eevee I see you don’t work for a Christian book store (for some reason this is the default example for unreasonable bosses)
So RSA’s defense is actually that they used the slowest algo as the default because elliptic curves were a hot trend. Brilliant
@dinodaizovi aww

@mtheoryx here is one kind http://t.co/QXIoY8izhW
@mtheoryx lol you know I never said it was chocolate I said it was brown dye
@mtheoryx like... brown dye.
@mtheoryx I don't see how being allergic to coca cola, pepsi, root beer, and all knockoffs could have anything to do with dairy.
@mtheoryx coffee, sorts of dark bread that aren't totally fakey, actual pure chocolate ie the expensive kind
@_JosephGrace is that not what I got when I double tapped home ?
@mtheoryx oh I am lactose intolerant but that's pretty much complete curable with pills.
@mtheoryx ie this bottled Starbucks stuff is brown as heck but it’s just actual coffee and milk
@kivikakk well that seems dramatic
@invalidname click the what

@mtheoryx yes, ones that are completely 100% naturally brown with no dyes
Yes hello how do I #%^* pause my music on iOS 7 because double tapping home doesn’t bring up that bar any more
@mtheoryx nah haven’t tried. I’m also randomly allergic to medicines so I’m pretty hesitant to try new ones.
“Why does my local mall have its own Wikipedia page” *click* “was the setting for the movie Mall Cop” … huh.
@vogon so the end result is that I like white chocolate, even the cheap stuff, more than nice chocolate because I don’t have a bad assoc
@mtheoryx well this will intrigue you: the exact reaction is that my ear canals inflame. Happens to my mother too.
@vogon it is a good excuse to buy expensive European chocolate, but the association has built up in my head to expect a reaction lol
@vogon basically: anything with cheap chocolate. All cola. Many breads, cereals, etc. They add brown dye to counterbalance fillers
@mtheoryx my life improved dramatically when I figured out the pattern and avoided mass-produced food that is a nice even brown.
@thegrugq @quine @0xcharlie all I know is that my theology teacher told us about this song and that it was from the devil.
@mtheoryx or I could not make myself miserable because it’s already happened enough hundreds of times
@mtheoryx I didn’t say it did! It’s to make it LOOK like chocolate.
@mtheoryx cola, chocolate candy, some brown breads, but not very pure stuff that is naturally brown like coffee.
@mtheoryx I don’t know! My family determined the common factor in everything I was allergic to was being brown, often artificially so.
@mtheoryx in actual (cheap) chocolate bars, to counterbalance the filler. In flavored foods, to make it more obviously chocolate flavored.
@mtheoryx pure chocolate obviously has no dye but how often does one actually have pure chocolate
@mtheoryx brown food dye in foods that contain chocolate flavor.
@mtheoryx you may have read my tweet backwards…v
@mtheoryx I’m allergic to brown food dye. It features in a very large percentage of chocolate flavored things.
@frkbmb @vogon roll the dice and find out what kind of chocolate is in Mass Produced Food Product X, eh? :)
@frkbmb @vogon no, I’m allergic to brown food dye, which most chocolate has to make it look “right”
I continue to be astounded at the number of people prejudiced against white chocolate. The fact that I’m never allergic to it kinda factors.
@frkbmb @vogon yeah and as a bonus I don’t have to wonder if I’m allergic to it
@mtheoryx well it’s a BRIBE what do you think   I mean uh
@vogon you know I’m allergic to the color brown right   No literally not joking

@dakami well, I was thinking hundreds trying hundreds of phones, if it’s against one phone I would want thousands.
@matthew_d_green one Starbucks gift card
@tapbot_paul I bet it’s the pulse. You’ve probably seen that video that’s shot to show up the guy's pulse under his skin
@dakami ie if hundreds of people try each other’s phones and come up with zero collisions, that’s a good sign it’s working as intended
@tapbot_paul perhaps if you stick your finger in ice water? Or is it looking for the pulse?
@dakami measure, measure, measure. It’s a black box to empirically verify.
@tapbot_paul perhaps I should say and their four best friends if we’re assuming five tries before lockdown
@objclxt those scanners are foolable with a flat image though, they’re not directly relatable.
@tapbot_paul what are the odds that the thief and their ten best friends might have a collision with my fingerprint?
@tapbot_paul for the actual testing I’m assuming a sacrificial lamb phone. But from a security point of view, if my phone were stolen,
@demize95 that’s the thing, I won’t be satisfied without some empirical third party measurements
Seriously though, I want to know if I could hand my phone off to ten thousand strangers and realistically expect zero fingerprint collisions

@johanjortso heheh do you mean my avatar? Her name is Kasane Teto and she is a parody of Hatsune Miku
@johanjortso "relic" is the word Rowling chose as the backup word that means something alike to hallows, so I guess so.
@johanjortso "hallows" is quite a peculiar word though. Almost all English speakers have only heard it in: "Hallowed be thy name" in prayer
@johanjortso ahh book 7: with a word in the title so obscure she had to make up a second title for other languages! :)
@johanjortso no they are completely different. They are soft pastels, largely color-coded after the first volume.
@johanjortso I actually don't think the American covers have all three on the front of any. The seventh may have the others on the back.
In retrospect, the Prime Minister's opening chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is rather clumsy. I don't like it.
@johanjortso Harry's looking pretty hot in that last one. And Hermione looks exactly like a WWII beauty lol

You don't actually not want *any* upper limit on user-controlled password length, everyone. Hashing is fixed output but it is not fixed time
@ShaneTheKing and then your backend is DoS'd by kids setting their passwords 8MB long and it has to hash them
@yacCz no, I really doubt it. At that high, it's just a limit so that you can't set rickroll.mp3 as your password...
@ShaneTheKing I think PHP defaults to 2MB or something, my novel is aaaalmost that long.
@ShaneTheKing (and if you want to define it as the maximum size a POST can be without crashing your server, that's fine.)
@ShaneTheKing hahahaha I will paste my novel just to spite you, that's what attackers do. The backend has to reject it at some point.
@ShaneTheKing there has to be a limit SOMEWHERE. And it's usually a heck of a lot lower than 200.

@ErrataRob @marshray @DrPizza the digit chars being in order is in fact required by the spec by some sweet mercy. Letters are not.
@acklost if you were free to do anything in c there would not be such a thing as undefined behavior :)
@ErrataRob @DrPizza right. It’s implementation dependent. Which is different from undefined.
@Tomi_Tapio what’s in the shed? That’s a weird place for one.
The C compiler knows exactly what is undefined, detecting it is not a problem. It likes to detect it and optimize it away :p
@techpractical @mcclure111 that’s undefined at the API level, not the language level
@DrPizza @ErrataRob yes. Otherwise every character could have the same value and that’d be fine
.@mcclure111 no, our code does not depend on undefined behavior. It depends on assuming it’s Not Really That Undefined.
Why do we all just accept that a C compiler will probably not mention anything if you hand it undefined behavior

@QuantumG I didn't pick my genes either if that's what you're getting at. But I could have been raised adoptively from day 1, it happens.
RT @blueg3: @0xabad1dea People seem to not understand that it's not about individuals, it's about population statistics.
@QuantumG So, of all possible parents in the world, that the two I had were a favorable outcome compared to average and worst case, is luck.
@QuantumG Um, absolutely nothing new agey about it. I didn't exist. And then I existed. And I had parents. I didn't pick them.
@QuantumG so yeah I'm lucky as hell
@QuantumG it was luck they were *MY* parents. Pure, completely uncontrollable happenstance.
@QuantumG I don't remember choosing who my parents were at character generation
@QuantumG that does not mean individual white kids are not poor. It means there is a system of biases larger than individual kids.
@QuantumG My area was 60% white, 30% black, 10% other, my CS program was ~98% white. It's not mysterious.
@QuantumG and judging by how many children I've seen discarded, having parents that truly care is pretty lucky and out of the kid's control.

@QuantumG @m1sp I don’t think any of us stated that having a computer induces being a programmer
@QuantumG and I’m a woman. It works out sometimes.
@xa329 @thegrugq what do you think mentors are…
Privilege is not a master on/off switch. It exists on several axes. As a white female bisexual once on welfare, I’m all over the map.
@QuantumG in *my* social context, being a poor white kid was measurably more privileged than being a poor black kid
@QuantumG but in the original context, being given the benefit of the doubt due to gender was part of the privilege equation
@QuantumG so did mine, and I put that at a middling rank of privilege. I’m thinking of the other kids.
@eevee the math they taught me in school has thus far proven not particularly relevant to programming except this addition stuff
# 369609438849945600
@QuantumG um okay yes that was kind of my point if your parents couldn’t afford a PC your chances of being a programmer go way down
@thegrugq @cs_saheel and they all wrote code I can hack with my eyes closed ;)
@QuantumG I was the only kid I knew in our welfare neighborhood with a computer. And now I have a Good Job and live in a Good Neighborhood
@QuantumG I had less privilege than a lot of kids. More than a lot of kids. It’s not a binary switch.
@QuantumG ie the problem is getting better because computers are getting cheaper and internet access more available
@QuantumG once we account for India, yes, they are undergoing a nascent computerized revolution, and I am quite glad.
@QuantumG I am not contradicting myself. My father spent every penny he had and some he didn’t on our first computer
@QuantumG note: speaking from an American context
@QuantumG gee, why are most programmers white? It almost seems to follow a similar curve to average household income by ethnicity
RT @Roguelazer: @eevee Computer towers are stereotypically beige. White man evolved programming as a form of camouflage in computer labs.
@QuantumG so getting a computer was a BIG DEAL but it was a deal that happened.
@QuantumG most of us in the west are at least a little. I grew up on welfare. Didn’t have food in the house sometimes.

@thegrugq I bet your code is nasty
@m1sp true, but Tarimin is not his native language, and Tsovinar notes he should talk in Asram as he sounds smarter
It’s privileged because the equipment, resources, and TIME are not trivial costs, and community feedback ie acceptance is very necessary

@collettiquette do you mean programming or linguistics? C and Dutch…
@yacCz but note, converting something that has its hash *appended* does not count, only the whole file counts
@yacCz sure, you can use a text file, except then you can’t hide your arbitrary padding and it’s ugly

@mister_borogove essentially I just implemented a static char buf for this function that happens to live within it :p
@mister_borogove no, it needs buffers right where I put 'em
@chead it is dosbox. And it is definitely taking longer than half a second.
Not making this up. I thought I was going crazy earlier when I found my MacBook unlocked! https://t.co/Jt2ewvgBhe

Uhh so if you lock a Mac with dosbox open it will unlock about five seconds later thanks dosbox
(or as opposed to my bulk of asm for NES with rom banks, where you also can't do that but for more basic reasons)
It feels so weird now that on DOS I can just put a buffer in the middle of my actual routine and write to it and the OS doesn't care

Also, I find it extremely amusing that my “x86 computer” has one x86 chip but possibly three or more ARM chips.
Also note how easy it was to circumvent the checksum. It’s clearly only checking for accidental corruption, not tampering.
@ShadowTodd no, I am pretty sure that one was an on-the-fly decision.
Absolutely top-notch research on reflashing hard drive controllers that just came out of OHM http://t.co/WQNWnVld58 they have ARM CPUs!!!
@billpollock awesome. Were you looking for a particular topic
There’s no point in warning tor users not to visit CP websites. Either they never do, or they will anyway. They already accepted huge risks.

@zedshaw I'm just saying, I doubt there are any nodes running on the same host as a Windows browser bundle. I hope.
@vogon it's the ONE thing the Feds can do right now that won't get them bad press, so...
@zedshaw so far the exploit has only targeted Windows, and most (all?) nodes are Linux, but it could conceivably be used to stage
@zedshaw I just mean that "tor servers" sounds like the actual tor nodes
Maybe we shouldn't put half of all anonymity services in the same colo next time

@meangrape that was kind of part of my broader implication to begin with.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon no, I called them stupid dummies I am pretty sure :)
@ScratchFreedom "normal" in quotes.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon there you go mis-ascribing things to me again :) I believe in both freedom of research and pressuring vendors to fix
The psych[iatrists|ologists] all started from the flawed premise that I wanted to be "normal." Oh hell no.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon in particular, the research that prompted this was not paid for by Volkswagen. They have no right to silence it
@SpireSec @monsterlemon my opinion that full disclosure is A Very Good Thing remains firmly in place, I assure you.
@thegrugq @homakov actually I just live in a liberal commie outpost called Massachusetts
@IRStrutt by ordinary locks I mean pretty much everything you're likely to see in the real world short of treasury vaults.
@homakov it's just a neighborhood very near clusters of tech companies. Rent is a bit high but not absurdly high.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon so this whole thing was you assuming I'm completely colorblind to nuances? :\
@SpireSec @monsterlemon maybe my philosophy is not a black and white 100% immutable absolutionist little thing :)
@IRStrutt I *have* a deadbolt. So?
.@homakov You're wrong. My neighborhood has as many Indians, Africans, and Asians in it as white folk. If not, added together, more.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon you don't understand the difference between being paid to do a review and choosing what to do with own research?
The psychiatrists I've met were all useless at dealing with someone who was never neurotypical to begin with. They lack imagination.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon how many times do I have to repeat in this conversation that oh guess what the world is still imperfect
@SpireSec @monsterlemon they're idiots who won't take advise they not only asked for but PAID for? That's stupidity beyond my reach to cure.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon and then OH MY GODS YOU ARE SETTING A POST VARIABLE AS A COMMAND TO RUN AS ROOT ON YOUR DB AAAUUUGH
@SpireSec @monsterlemon we rank things by ease of exploitation and severity of impact. It's up front that most findings are fairly minor.
@elad3 yes, and the psychiatrists failed from top to bottom to really understand at all what I do
Now, I live in what you call a Nice Neighborhood, and that itself is a stronger mitigation than the actual locks.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon (many of our customers come to us AFTER they were publicly owned.)
@SpireSec @monsterlemon not 100% of the time. Sometimes we get in shouting matches with them about it. But usually.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon it turns out our customers actually fix the flaws, because they came to us because they WANTED to fix them.
The psychiatrists actually made a big deal about me worrying about stuff being broken into, as if it were irrational.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon My employer discloses everything found to the entity that paid for the review. My personal stuff is full disclose
@SpireSec @monsterlemon I don't know why you'd think I'd think everything is ever fixed. Being vigilant is my *job.*
@SpireSec @monsterlemon World Is Flawed - Perfect Security Not Measurable - Reel At Eleven
@SpireSec @monsterlemon stuff don't get fixed until it's disclosed because vendors are cheap. Disclose, disclose, disclose.
@thegrugq thank you doctor buddha
@SpireSec @monsterlemon "Known" vulns can be fixed. "Unknown" vulns can be exploited without detection.
I have a constant anxiety about my house and car being broken into because I know how !@#$ useless ordinary locks are. No peace of mind :(
@SpireSec @monsterlemon but my tolerance for known and unpatched flaws is effectively 0%.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon and who said there is no threshold of tolerances?
@SpireSec @monsterlemon but indeed, no software system yet devised by the minds of mortals has proven unquestionably secure.
@SpireSec @monsterlemon I said "it can't be secure if there are known vulns (that are not fixed)"
@SpireSec @monsterlemon yes that is definitely my position. That is all the nuances precisely

@CliffsEsport I, too, base all my philosophy on fantasy novels (it's true. I just also happen to write the fantasy novels I base it off of)
@CliffsEsport I'm pretty sure I don't have any 6th grade art teachers to oppose at the moment
@CliffsEsport no actually, my childhood access to fantasy novels was fairly restricted.
@CliffsEsport I sincerely regret my past willingness to submit to arbitrary authority.
@CliffsEsport oh, if I had known what I know now, I would have turned a lot more things in late or incomplete, instead of being an angel.
@CliffsEsport I think I am old enough, smart enough, and SUCCESSFUL enough to say no, she didn't teach me anything.
@CliffsEsport she completely ruined something I had worked very hard on and was proud of, solely out of spite. Could have written on back
@CliffsEsport I already *knew* it wasn't supposed to be late. She taught me nothing save contempt for arbitrary judgment.

@SpireSec ........... yeah I haven't spent the last eight years thinking about this or anything
@SpireSec no offense but you're not even making sense to me anymore. It can't be secure if known vulns aren't fixed.
@SpireSec it's objectively *fixed* when the exploit don't work no more. That doesn't mean objectively secure.
@SpireSec the customers already HAVE breakable locks. Criminals already HAVE private research going on.
@SpireSec time and time and time again stuff doesn't get FIXED until vendors have their nose rubbed in it by angry customers

I know I don't have kids, but I've made a point of observing the parents of kids I think are smart.

@jrmithdobbs and I note that this entire process was an EXCEPTION to our usual methods; you never hear about our thousands of routine scans.
@jrmithdobbs it uses sound, non-novel algorithms. The bug was not in a novel (homegrown) algorithm, it was in an entropy failure.

@brinxmat yes, that kind of supports my point ;) the first waves, who did the hardest part, were religious exiles, criminals, etc.
@SimonZerafa in the end the bug comes down to where I always said the bugs would be in JS — the genre of casting errors.
@SimonZerafa we don’t specifically offer JavaScript line-by-line auditing, no. At least not yet.
@SimonZerafa we did a manual penetration test to verify that it behaved as the spec advertised.
@brinxmat ah, back in the old days, we did it with slavery and indentured servitude (which is slavery with a time limit, for Europeans!)

@killerswan @oh_rodr also, there are many religions in the world with priests, and the requirements for all of them tend to vary :)
@killerswan @oh_rodr you don’t need a law to stop you from doing something you sincerely believe is wrong.

@raudelmil though I do live in a townhouse so the neighbors might. But, this is in many people's radio astronomy charts.
@raudelmil well, I don't think I own any devices with RAM at that speed, as I made a point of surveying them recently.
@travisgoodspeed (and this 1420.8 signal was there when I was picking up the 1420.4 one)
@mattblaze it's always there no matter which antenna I use, including none (the radio still picks things up very fainly w/o one)
@travisgoodspeed no, I got the hydrogen line last night, where it's meant to me, at 1420.4 :)
But at least I know it's not RAM (someone makes RAM at that speed apparently) if SETI was seeing it over a decade ago.

@dan_crowley and anyway patriarchynormalizationofprivilegesplained is a mouthful.
@dan_crowley I never said it has nothing to do with being a man! Being a man is necessary but not sufficient to be a mansplainer
@dan_crowley and, gods forgive me, I’ve probably whitesplained to someone at some point.
@dan_crowley it is something women say to other women, who nod and understand and commiserate.
@dan_crowley The word “mansplaining” is not used as a weapon. It can’t be. It bounces off, meaningless to them.
@dan_crowley mansplaining is not about being a man! It is about being a man noted for talking down to women.
@dan_crowley they both are meant to imply there’s something shameful about being a woman or being gay.
@dan_crowley because people who abuse privilege sometimes need a cold slap in the face to remember they have it.
@dan_crowley whitesplaining turns up hits on google and of course on tumblr… speaking only for myself, I’d use the word readily.
@dan_crowley it is the best word I know for that feeling when a man looks down his nose when I open my mouth.  Certain men. Never all.
@dan_crowley it’s of privileged origin. If we gave all power to redheads, I’d be a brownie subjected to gingersplaining no doubt.
@chriseng @ioerror @kylemaxwell As I recall, you were there too, though you missed out on some good pizza…
@dan_crowley it is about power balance.
@dan_crowley When there comes a time when a womanly congress tells a man he shall not have a vasectomy for his own good, womansplainers all.

@dan_crowley and it’s slangy, but I’m not sure what better way to term the phenomenon of certain men telling women what women think.
@dan_crowley a man saying something does not make him a mansplainer; it is not an insult that casts a shadow over the whole gender.

@scottmarkwell I sincerely doubt they are bothering to record the SSL sessions of completely public websites they can also subpoena.
@mescyn I’d assume. But the fact that decrypting things is on the table is concerning :p
@mescyn but it’s allowed to be kept for the broadest reasons of vaguest suspicion of maybe possibly someday even if domestic
@amazingant I’m just saying that the rules say encrypted data may be retained forever until it can be cracked if they want to.
These rules portray encrypted communication as being inherently suspicious and easy to get authorization to store indefinitely.
If the director of whatever is allowed to sign off on multiple communications at a time, it’d be trivial to authorize basically everything.
@chriseng and we know for total sure they’re not allowed to sign off on multiple communications with one signature?
@chriseng their definition in 2(i) is so broad that it reads to me like a single sign-off could cover eg all data from a certain tap
@vogon but did you make the gun
@eevee they malign the bit operators, but I’m guessing every php script I’ve ever written, save the random quotes one, uses those things
@chriseng and doesn’t it sound… INCREDIBLY broad? Minding that it may be retained FOREVER even if domestic ?
Please do read these documents — less for the rules themselves, more for the technical practices implied. http://t.co/ZCPzKYsWw9
@chriseng may I have your thoughts on section 2(i) of the second document and the broad retention thereof
@vogon I guess that was his cunning plan
@vogon that graphics design is worth more than $50
Uh hey this document straight up says they may retain any encrypted communication regardless of who sent it FOREVER until it is cracked
@20committee as a technical person, their definition of inadvertent collection includes a huge chunk of all internet traffic.
Note that they say they get rid of “incidental” American communications if it’s CLEARLY NOT related, not that it isn’t clearly is.
Oh hey they list “equipment emanations” under types of data they store !

@gdbassett @ra6bit yeah it does, that's what I'm saying. There's an audit trail, and he probably had power over it.

Apparently I have the wavs and midis to SimCity 2000 in my oldest backup folder for no particular reason, then.
What game from the 90s had a helicopter pilot ("mayday!" "I'm hit!") and a woman who said "reticulating splines"? I have these wavs...
@uppfinnarn who's checked in from every major city on earth within a span of hours
I have a feeling that this NES rom dump with a file creation date is 1983 is stretching the definition a bit
@Kufat though I don't have any HARD DRIVES I've been using since 1997.
@Kufat It's from a game I had installed in the 90s, though I can't remember what game.
@invalidname Apple naively didn't anticipate it being used as a tracker.

@thegrugq actually it was the Governor's School of Math and Science, which was hosted by my university
When I worked at a summer boarding school I sneaked a scan of Harry Potter 7 to the kids. They had no other means, poor angels.
@theLoneFuturist @_yossi_ depends. Are we talking 64MB per movie or for all eight? :p
@_yossi_ Was working in a school at the time. Copied it to USB and snuck it to the kids.
@_yossi_ yeah I had that too. I felt no guilt because I had already paid for the preorder.
@zeroday no, I don't remember tape drives. I have literally never seen one in my life.
.@_yossi_ I mean PDFs of the Harry Potter books (If I could compress the movies to 64MB I'd be rrrrrrrrich)
Found a 64MB zip I made when I was a teenager of my Most Important Files... mostly bootleg Harry Potter... and some anime wallpapers.
@Aranjedeath it's basically a trail of every picture that ever made me smile, even if I can't quite remember the reason.
I remember downloading it over dialup onto a Gateway laptop running Windows 2000 Professional.

@chriseng and my point of view is that it’s so basic that any literate person is qualified to comment with gravity.
@vierito5 it’s not the number of requests, it’s the number of unique accounts covered by requests. Hint: it’s secretly A LOT

Okay, you know what bugs me? “You’re not a Constitutional scholar therefore you can’t criticize.” It’s not THAT hard to read and comprehend.
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet either that you know a lot of white males, or that the patriarchy is working as it always has re self-hate :)
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet and if Occupy victim stats lean white (I think they do), that’s because the protest leans white, because etc.
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet statistics always have shown that you’re LESS safe from cops if you’re not white
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet or that certain faces of occupy say things like this https://t.co/qCDHAbG8BP

I think my biggest social responsibility is to remember I grew up on welfare, and to remember the reasons each family was there.
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet though, for the theoretical average white straight male, economic position is the key distinguishing factor.
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet I’m white, not male, not straight, formerly poor but no longer. All of these affect me, not just class.
@scumbagjames @0x17h @lumeet so it’s not possible for problems to exist on more than one dimension? :p

Well apparently the iPad beta isn’t even in beta yet! Hmph.
So I can put iOS 7 on my iPad with the corporate developer account, right ? After the download server recovers from heart attack, of course
@lil_lost OSX updates tend to stretch a lot further.
@Anon_Central the hell? You’re not qualified to be an anon spokesperson if you’re going to be blatantly sexist
@thegrugq certainly not until after lunch Mavericks time…
@carl_vinas good grief man stop encouraging them to make an iPad every six months !
Well that’s over. Back to the part where the NSA lied to the public by playing “cute” word games
@cji @jack_daniel I couldn’t watch the stream but Ars said it’s iPad 4 and Mini.
@quine it just deactivated, it’s safe
@Megan @grp and now she has an optional man-voice!

.@Sonikku_a I mean to be a *source* of public location-based app usage data
“Find the most popular apps based on LOCATION” where do I opt the heck out
@invalidname well the iPad mini is, to my understanding, an iPad 2, and that’s supported
@janardanyri I had one, it was actually fine IME. I got a 4th and gave the 3rd to a family member
@runasand what the heck kind of venue checks citizen status?!
Wait, did they just say it’s supported on 4th gen iPad but not 3rd even though they’re basically identical and six months apart?
@thegrugq http://t.co/gkYHtfuaGY I roll ascii-style
Oh gods. I had already managed to forget the word “mavericks” and there they go bringing it up again
@segfault314 no it does not! It’s my one major criticism of Apple’s security model vs. others.

Oh oh did they call Firefox's performance on OSX "kinda sad"? Preach the truth !! (But I use Chrome, not Safari, so uh, yeah)
.@Kim_Bruning yeah but like... who scatters all the related files for a project across the disk but takes the time to tag them?
But leading-edge science indicates that's a stupid name for an OS and I refuse to call it that
Tagging? I thought that was called folders…

Why do people make non-parody fake accounts? It’s not funny or insightful.

@CEJohnson_CEO @anamariecox but it actually *worked* this time and that kind of matters
In other news: it’s pretty manipulative of Nintendo to put play icons for games you don’t own on the main screen
@DrPizza I thought we all agreed by now that “direct access” meant via the order process rather than off the fiber taps…
@DrPizza @raudelmil maybe (just speculating) he had reason to believe going to Iceland would raise suspicions at home
The Guardian says Snowden leaked “the NSA files” and linked to this page http://t.co/QWUj0sUJMx so presumably he leaked the Verizon Order
What is right is not defined by what is legal. One had best hope that the opposite, however, is true.
@TheWarRoom_Tom @20committee I’ll grant that, minus the unnecessary ageism, if you can define Turing machine without googling :)
@Dell56 @anamariecox please understand that exchanging data willingly with a service provider is very different from all data being siphoned
@gallifreyan @Twirrim different person, completely arbitrary, coming though the RT chain.
I assume the bit about Hong Kong is less “champion of free speech” and more “champion of a perfect opportunity to show up America” :p
“We” (the broader security/privacy community) have been preaching the Bad News for years, but our audience is a trifle bigger now
@CEJohnson_CEO @anamariecox I was also talking about this in 2006 (when I was a minor), where was my audience?
Basically a surveillance apologist told me that a judge said it’s okay therefore it’s okay. No deeper concept of morality?
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox yes, I completely disagree with your entire premise from roots to roof, but whatever.
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox than*
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox I have a big fucking problem.
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox that presumes that “having a fisa warrant” is ethical. But the Verizon Order is 100% a blanket order of all calls
Got RT’d by someone with over a million followers which is cool except for the flood of invasive surveillance apologists
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox I said stop arguing about prism because there’s this OTHER problem people are forgetting
@TheBigFoxx @anamariecox but the Verizon Order is  Don’t tell me everyone forgot already :(

@20committee do you always extrapolate to huge groups of people based on one who did something you don’t like? :)
@20committee you know, technical skill with computers has little to no correlation with formal education. All good hirers know this…
@justinschuh which is great! But the underlying theme of the NSA being far too data-happy remains
@justinschuh I’m saying there’s been a huge kerfuffle over what direct access means and it apparently does NOT mean google gave them root
STOP arguing over the semantics of prism “direct access” — HELLO THEY’RE COLLECTING ALL PHONE METADATA  ALL  PHONE  METADATA
So, Snowden leaked the indisputably evil Verizon Order, right? The NSA-loyal are trying so hard to mudsling all over him right now.
@kcarmical well you’re always your parents’ child no matter how old you get, that’s a different use of the word…
@justinschuh didn’t he leak the Verizon order too? Not a lot of room for not understanding that.
@WickedSmaaaht @20committee I am interested in this definition of childhood which includes being twenty-nine years old
Now the former NSA’er is retweeting things calling 29 years old a “kid”
@zorm presumably @ggreenwald would have a good idea if this was the person who sent him the docs or not
@chead his username is 20committee , not atted because I’m not looking for a fight.
That former NSA’er I twitter-collected seems to be primarily offended that $200,000 wasn’t enough to shut Snowden up.

@dewitt if it’s any consolation, I genuinely believe Google puts in its best effort to try to resist
@dewitt what I originally meant was the govt calls leaking “reckless” because oh no people are complaining !
@dewitt you need to get your sarcasm detector calibrated
@dewitt yes, it is well established I am Supreme Leader of Earth.
.@bhelyer context is reporting *true* things (like Verizon Order, everyone can agree that’s true and govt is so upset)
Media can only be “reckless” if it gets people hurt. Bruised egos don’t count.
@wimremes … referring to the tendency of services to spew identifying data when you connect to them before auth.
@wimremes it’s clearly casual terminology…
@wimremes then I guess he means “the data returned when one simply connects to an open tcp port”
@wimremes lol context?

@tangenteroja @xa329 the host name isn’t in the Netherlands! It’s presumably in England but GeoIP says it’s in Colorado
@PBTender they're definitely from Africa, but I'm embarrassed to say I can't identify more specifically than that.
@PBTender I promise I could identify Greek!
@xa329 I'm starting in Sweden, but it seems everything I could possibly connect to outside Sweden goes through same spot in the Netherlands
I can usually identify languages but the couple of families picnicing out in the yard have me stumped. And their food smells good.
@dshaw_ in my case it was a parody account with like five followers.

@crstry confusing they didn't say londuk in which case it would have been obvious
What the heck, Twitter is urging me to "reconnect with [username], use a tweet to get in touch"  Back off, Twitter
@crstry @tangenteroja I think someone's suggestion of Lond[on], En[gland], UK is correct
.@Yirba_ stop being reasonable
@ebcube and the US, is, in fact, a major cable hub!
I suspect the GeoIP is incorrect for that, but that would imply that someone in London didn't know how to spell London and that's just sad
@ebcube They're mostly interested in connections with where servers are, I assume!
@ebcube but wouldn't connecting to Spain provide an overall faster internet experience with fewer hops?
Guess the geolocation of this host's IP: http://t.co/YDHlwz0YD3  Hint: it's a place that can't spell London
@ebcube yeah but... what about all the cables that have absolutely nothing to do with such a concept, why would this one be special
@r4vi I am. We're not *all* monolingual ;)
I admit I'm really confused why everyone assumes that the placement of long-distance cables has to do with language ancestry. o_O
@r4vi I know, I can read it.
@tangenteroja that was kind of my entire point
@ebcube I don't think that's how networking cables are laid ^-^;
@deathtolamo um... none... I just tracerouted from my machine in Sweden to South Africa
@aris_ada @meikk I have no idea, but if it does, why not just alias traceroute?
According to the traceroute I just did, the Netherlands has a direct connection to South Africa??
@tangenteroja yes, that is what I have been yelling at the top of my lungs about for a few days now
"E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?" You're the computer, you tell me!
Why on earth does this ubuntu install have traceroute6 installed but not traceroute
@giovannibajo I consider SSL mandatory, but there is still a lot of metadata, and the US can’t simply up and seize servers or whatever

@elad3 my Arrogant American(tm) opinions on Israel as a government are not very favorable
@r00tine though how many are properly regulated? Probably like two :(
@r00tine yes, but it’s not an inherent trait of intelligence agencies to tap civilian fiber, if they are properly regulated
@elad3 routing through most of those places would already see a lot of arbitrary dropped connections
Of course — I’m sure other countries are spying too. But I doubt any of them have as big a budget.
@RSWestmoreland I assume…
@octal unfortunately I don’t think there’s a good way to route to the rest of North and South America without going through US
@jgeorge the only gun I’ve ever owned is the NES light gun

@profoundlypaige that looks incredibly painful
Hey - someone who claims to be former NSA (@20committee) says to read this http://t.co/rpSpy0koSG and it actually makes A LOT OF SENSE
@chriseng but we’re arguing until we’re blue in the face about semantics, which is spot on for our industry
@grp and bless their hearts. But the point is more getting people to actually acknowledge that it’s real and happens a lot!
@matthew_d_green they do specifically deny getting an order THAT absurdly broad.
@grp — through direct communications with employees, *as opposed to* fiber taps.
@grp and that’s my point; that “direct access” was taken to mean, like, a shell on the database server, when really they mean it goes —
@DrPizza we knew all of this for ages, really
@grp “Here is a letter which describes what we want. Fulfill it or see us in court.”
@grp I’ve posted or retweeted all the links to them myself. They agree with me: they have direct SOCIAL access. Whether they want to or not
Anyway if we take the new slide as being real it seems to unambiguously agree that massive fiber datataps are totally a thing, yay!
@grp and it seems the PPT meant direct access in a social sense, not a technical one.

@dijama I don't always agree with my opinions either!
@gangstahugs and congresswomen, and congressbeasts of all stripes of monstrosity.
@innismir @thegrugq by common sense? Yes, insofar as the EULA/ToS goes. By the NSA's twisted definition? No.
I hold this truth to be self-evident: that the right to free speech, privacy, and freedom of association does not depend on geography
@innismir @thegrugq yes, but that's a tiny footnote to the broad theme
@innismir @thegrugq I believe that privacy and freedom of association are *human* rights. I would be remiss not to stand up for them.
@innismir @thegrugq same difference, considering how bloody difficult it is to get in here legally
@xa329 @wimremes we hold these truths to be self-evident, that life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness only apply to people born here
@Mr_Reed_ now that, I actually would not say, as the censorship is active rather than passive
@thegrugq American exceptionalism is so ingrained that many perfectly nice people are confused why I'd say foreigners have the same rights

It’s here! It’s going to be an exciting weekend http://t.co/ZNZqdb3Zkx
So we’re in a weird position where the companies deny it but the government does not, just that the article contains inaccuracies
@demize95 I think the compiler is only allowed to error on things that cannot be compiled
@0x6D6172696F @lcamtuf I think what is true all falls under Google’s concession that it is forced to play along with SOME stuff.
@0x6D6172696F @lcamtuf well, it’s 100% possible to be involved with prism and not know it by that name;

@yakushim do I really believe that privacy is a right if I say “well of course not for people born outside of this arbitrary border”?
@yakushim I can’t force foreign governments to do what I think is right, but I can do what I think is right: to apply human rights evenly
@kcarmical unfortunately there is no perfect answer as to where exactly the line goes — just doesn’t go where it is now!
@tapbot_paul yeah, why not?
@kcarmical transparent, accountable, limited? Or just “we said it’s legal therefore you can’t stop us neener neener”?
@tapbot_paul (obviously some American rights, such as to not quarter soldiers, don’t translate to this context)
@tapbot_paul in this context I’m talking about basic rights like communication, free association, privacy and being presumed innocent
@kcarmical secret snooping by secret programs for secret reasons == totally invalid and morally bankrupt
@tapbot_paul it’s not a “right” if you stop treating people with respect because they don’t have feet on the right dirt
@kcarmical my stance is there’s no valid reason to go digging around outside a specific, documented, transparent criminal investigation
@kcarmical basically what the govt is saying is they would never read *my* gmail, how awful, but my BFF in Australia, fair game!
@kcarmical respecting the basic human rights of communication is not putting the concerns of foreigners above Americans
@blowdart I’d let you vote but nobody asked me, funnily enough.

@vogon not necessarily? I’d assume it would have some semi-idiot-proof interface for data monkeys to use
@RSWestmoreland @HackerNewsTips yes, and that’s what we want to happen

@superMTW block me, it works better.
@superMTW o____O cool story bro  Spying on the general public is wrong no matter where they live
@superMTW and it’s a REAL EXAMPLE of something that was TOTALLY LEGAL in THIS COUNTRY.
@superMTW I’m way out of line? I didn’t extrapolate. I just copy-pasted the logic that something is moral if it’s majority.
@superMTW just like a huge majority of the American public was okay with slavery?
@superMTW just because something has “always been done” doesn’t mean it’s okay
@superMTW …. Sooooooooo?
@superMTW seriously? Whether or not a human being deserves basic rights depends on whether they have a foot on our chunk of dirt?
@superMTW this one is about the Verizon thing, actually. But so dirty evil foreigners don’t deserve no privacy?

@puellavulnerata probably because it’s so compromising that the NSA would literally be out for their blood.
@puellavulnerata pretty sure they have deliberately not posted the whole thing
I can’t even keep track of what already leaked vs suspected anymore
@excsc not by THEIR definition. By THEIR definition, automated collection is not surveillance, only human eyeballs is
How paranoid is it to think the US would trade data with close allies so they can each “not spy” on their own citizens?
@innismir nothing! I’m just using it for its shielding
@kyhwana and I can’t go into it, but suspicion of US govt interest is not unfounded in this instance
@kyhwana a log-on to the account from within the Google Datacenter itself. No similar things in other accounts

@DrPizza as my father with a clearance says: “Half of all rumors are true and half of what they say is a lie. But you’ll never know which”
@RSWestmoreland @pmocek @declanm AOL is listed under prism…

I undid a retweet because the domain name in the image didn’t exist, but it turns out their admin is just incompetent

@ELLIOTTCABLE prism, I’m not saying it is, I say I’m reserving a chance for it to be
… Though the information, as presented, is technically feasible IMO.
@redtwitdown @jperkin government officials are not known for aesthetic taste
Since this follows last night’s news so closely, I do reserve a chance of it being an elaborate hoax meant to ride the media wave
.@panther_modern suggests (via Ars comment) the codename PRISM may refer to fiber splitters “reflecting” the data stream; farfetched?

@Pepyri_ well, it’s completely unambiguous that Apple can decrypt iCloud and iMessage server-side
@trevortimm @0x17h I have a problem, and that problem is the urge to simplify your statement to not include Skype and YouTube
@Pepyri_ well the gov immediately admitted the thing he published last night was real, so let’s see what they say tomorrow :)
@Pepyri_ and apparently Paltalk is big in the Middle East? idk. But @ggreenwald thinks it’s legit and he’s pretty good at this
@Pepyri_ I’d assume gmail is easily the biggest, most important, most useful thing on that list (even gets a separate icon from google)
@Pepyri_ as it syncs constantly what you have in the text editor
@Pepyri_ non-technicals are prone to incorrect descriptions of technical capability; but in gmail’s case that could actually be literal true
@Pepyri_ I doubt there’s a unified interface for all of them, it’s probably very piecemeal and ad hoc
@SteveD3 though adamant refusal is not out of the question given they’ve resisted smaller things.
@SteveD3 relatively low volume of private data, I assume.
Of course the PowerPoint is terrible. That’s how you know it’s legit: the NSA graphics department doesn’t have the clearance
@m1sp though, the amount of data passing through twitter that is private is very small compared to the public data.
@DrPizza because the graphics department doesn’t have the clearance. Duh.
@kaepora I heard in Japan they call it “the fox god takes a bride” so the association with deity actions seems cross-cultural

@myfreeweb private by default is the only way to ensure privacy is ready when it's needed.
@myfreeweb if the person downloading it happens to consider that act private, because they're in Censorship Nation, they're out of luck.

@elad3 @glyph If I knew THAT...
@meursalt Gov never silently disappears people who leak. They make a big show of it.
@glyph yeah, pretty much. It's the issued certificates that are broken, not the cryptography.
@Kufat #FactsFrom1998
@Wxcafe that was the (fix HTTPS) part :p
I think it's high time we push to get plaintext HTTP officially classified as a legacy protocol in favor of HTTPS. (And then fix HTTPS)

@0xcharlie according to the rest of twitter, you were taught wrong
@tapbot_paul no it goes to 1.7ghz
@unixronin one of those is too easy, the other too hard ;)
@ptolts the computer's emissions!
@tapbot_paul my install process was get the nightly of SDR# and try each of the zadig drivers until one (of three iirc) worked
@ptolts nothing! But it's made of shielding
@MakagiAkito radio science !
It's working http://t.co/SgCdFnTGTe
oh yeah new followers: I kind of have this hobby of seeing what weird things I can pick up from electronics with a radio ;)
@octoqueer @xepheraux shielding :)
"Just throw out that old microwave", they said. "What possible use is it..." http://t.co/WkGHytvS29
@HaydnJohnson it’s a good idea that desperately needs that pending service pack.
Yeah so about those discount radios: don’t jiggle the connector http://t.co/oVlrlWmIcy
@stillchip @0x17h this is a real signal; the artifacts on this radio show as thin lines down the middle of the baseband.
@_larry0 yeah, plenty of apps can artificially generate this sort of noise, but this is *artisanal* white noise sourced from local waves
@_larry0 it's just generic analog white noise, very clean/quiet in FM
@bmirvine too low, you need one of those shifter thingies
I have no idea what's generating this white noise at 74.25mhz but I find it very pleasant to listen to
@akopa I've been convinced it's oiler
@innismir I ordered ten, both to have spares and to give some away
I should probably figure out how to pronounce Fourier huh

Oh look at that the noise gets stronger when the screen gets darker... https://t.co/oe8WvKQu7d
@Mr_Reed_ yeah, and Dutch and Danish people are, on the whole, extraordinarily tall
@Kufat not from my timestamp’s point of view
@jennifurret iTunes backup / iCloud backup?
@sneakin I’ll keep them in their very benign wrappers. “Mini digital TV stick”
@coolacid I doubt it gets more generic than a $10 USB stick from china with no model number on the packaging :)
@Mr_Reed_ ie I am taller than almost every woman on earth. But I don’t feel tall.
@Mr_Reed_ it turns out your definition of average may be skewed in comparison to the global population
You better hope I get accepted to Defcon because I’ll bring all these radios with me…
@aquavitaecoll I didn’t get this to tune into television :) SDR just stands for software defined radio
It came with a CD! Who dares me to install the TV viewer app
Here is the exact model I ordered — paid $12 ea from someone with free shipping, but some merchants go down to $10 http://t.co/PPyDNUjyOo
@silentbicycle http://t.co/PPyDNUjyOo
The $10 radios work! The antenna is just especially bad (but replaceable)
Wow, we really do need a tumblr for Kerry being awkwardly tall http://t.co/K5erAcOybW
I like to swap out USB devices while the computer is asleep and imagine it having an identity crisis when it wakes up
@Balgan they’re FC0013 according to the description, we’ll see :p
@Balgan I just got on Ali Express and searched for the cheapest SDR that included antenna.
zomg these plastic cases aren’t sealed, they just open! This packager has my undying admiration
@bhelyer @kevinmarks (yes, I assume we were all joking :) )
@bryanbrannigan they went halfway around the world safe and sound, so good enough
@kevinmarks and we got labor protection laws first; we need to get more protections for people all over the world

@RadCurmudgeon @decivilized @0x17h thanks for telling me what my beliefs, practices, and convictions are! PS you’re wrong! Blocked!
@RadCurmudgeon @decivilized @0x17h sorry I can’t hear you over the sound of how awesome and apolitical radio astronomy is
It’s time to quit an argument when the other person says science is bad because sometimes it changes its mind
@0x17h I assume they just have a twitter search for their group to keep abreast of it
@RadCurmudgeon @decivilized @0x17h but I just came here to giggle at the Primitive Twitter Tribe and get back to studying science
@RadCurmudgeon @decivilized @0x17h I think you’re extrapolating a bit if you think I think that’s totally okay
@0x17h well… yes. You are definitely a magnet for argument.
@RadCurmudgeon @decivilized @0x17h I don’t remember the gun part the last few times I was homeless, but that’s my first world privilege…
@decivilized @RadCurmudgeon @0x17h (nor are all miners coerced or left in excessively unsafe conditions)
@0x17h I only accept anti-technology arguments written on vellum by a small, privileged literate class
@RadCurmudgeon @0x17h @decivilized Foxconn is the most awful thing but that doesn’t mean its abuse is an axiom
@aaqian @eevee but then it’d be pink…!
@decivilized @0x17h … but you must realize that complaining about technology on the internet just sounds very silly.
@decivilized @0x17h why would I have a theoretical understanding of someone else’s random personal beliefs

@panther_modern so deliberately spreading *dangerous* falsehoods hoping that people will fall for it is cruel.
@panther_modern the difference is: you can’t BLAME a child for doing something stupid.
@panther_modern yeah, because there are no children on the internet, only stupid adults
@donicer the fact that blog is read by many children and they know it is especially cruel.

@brentrubell as for why unix scripts tend to break on spaces, well. That’s a problem older than most people I know…
@brentrubell you have a space in the directory name again :p
@indrora okay, that sounds like expected behavior and doesn't interact with the core complaint that it's implemented as a fake function.
@brentrubell this perhaps? https://t.co/WMuPYY82tr
@brentrubell @stroughtonsmith it's choking on the space in the pathname. Either remove the space or edit install.sh to cope.
@kivikakk ... ... ... ....
@comex then define a new syntax rather than overriding existing syntax and returning a parse error for completely, utterly valid syntax
@comex The fact that it converts the argument to a string is both a given and immaterial. The point is, it keeps calm and carries on.
@comex php &gt; if(defined(NULL)) { echo "true\n"; } else { echo "false\n"; }   false
@indrora Which sounds like another WTF, but this author wonders how does that change the underlying point?
@mof18202 more effective than heatsinks
@comex I clearly use "in my OPINION" several times to mark where I think the underlying design is bad.
@comex what's still wrong? Is anything I said about isset's behavior factually untrue?
Dear twitter engineers who follow me: &lt;3 &lt;3 I rage because I care  Dear PHP fans who follow me: &gt;:) &gt;:) I rage because I revel in your tears
@comex I discuss in the article why it's like sizeof() except worse.
@ameaijou I guess "well don't design it that way next time!" doesn't cut it ;)
@chriseng @focalintent http://t.co/c35oHQkYaH
@comex and that justifies a massive exception to the general structure of the language instead of just returning false?

@raudelmil my problem is that it acts short on CPU when I ask it to render multiple streams of sound simultaneously and it stutters

@dangoodin001 @ErrataRob if you prefer conspiracy theories maybe they really botched the next patch and are blaming the downtime on skids ;)
@dangoodin001 @ErrataRob I think it’s just technobabble for “stopping this DDoS has not proved trivial and we’re doing all that we can”
@ameaijou also it’s not necessarily the wording of the manual that is the problem, but the subject matter which it must cover…

@anthonicaldwell the NES is inherently tile-based; 60 times a second you have a chance to change tiles.

@thereals0beit … I am very passionate about hating PHP.
@thereals0beit which is fine for native assembly macro wrappers like C but PHP claims to be a gods damned web language.
@thereals0beit it wouldn’t be their fault if a programmer had to go way the hell out of their way to cause this. PHP is ownable by default.
@thereals0beit Of course it’s bad. And they DON’T KNOW and the language does none of the many things within its power to help them.
@voltagex the “bad tutorial” I learned from was written by the inventor of PHP. The problem goes straight to the core.
Remember: most of those devs genuinely have no idea what the dangers of throwing GETs into query strings like that are. #blamePHP
@Tesseraction PHP: from zero to owned in more trivial ways than one can enumerate. There’s a reason I preach against using it.
@Tesseraction yes. Note: not literally every single one of these is unsafe. But most are.

@securityskeptic @WeldPond one can’t rectify a decade of lax security by moving from three patch cycles a year to four.

@FVT too little too late. Java is a mature project and it’s been Oracle’s responsibility for a few years now.

Click link to iOS App Store, receive spew of json. Yes, yes this is helpful
@kyhwana that was the only justification I was aware of… she was a bit too sheltered, I think.
@kyhwana the best part is she ASSUMED he did illegal drugs. The shadiest thing he ever did was give a 20yo a beer
@kyhwana this same furry friend of mine also liked to drink though and my mother seemed horrified I would hang out with him
@kyhwana nope, never had a drink in my life
@kyhwana I’m not a furry though :p I also don’t remember at all why I had a cat ears headband that day
@kyhwana … when I walked in with kitty ears she gave me a look like I said I was gay. But that didn’t happen yet.
@kyhwana well, see, there was this boy, who I was friends with, who was a furry, and I don’t know exactly what he told her about it but…
@waruikoohii I think she was mostly afeared that the young man who had told her about being a furry was corrupting my innocent youth
True story: my mother found out what furries are the same day I happened to come home in a kitty ear headband.
@kyhwana considering who the author is, I’m surprised that text isn’t really offensive (in my opinion anyway)
Hmm… furries, when did you wake up and realize you’d gone mainstream? http://t.co/3tPTtEvRR7

@RSnake you realize I mean the doll I am holding right? Though I will double check with the Pinkie Pie you are probably thinking of :p
Oh, and taking a picture on the spot is different from accessing photos already stored. The prior doesn’t need location services.
People saying it doesn’t: you forgot the instructions on how to make it not do that.
Also: Twitter for iPhone now requires “location services” to use photos. It didn’t used to. Whaaaaat

Got in a semi-argument on reddit and the other person used the word “presunpyious.” So now I imagine they’re an 8yo sounding it out.
@mike_acton I’m not sure. It’s just a gut reaction. I guess they have more history than most kick starting groups, though.
@mike_acton though clearly they’re not going to have any trouble convincing people to trust they’re double-good for it :p
@landley it came out a few weeks ago.
@mike_acton — beyond all shadow of a doubt before they presume to ask for more kick funding.
@mike_acton I’ve kicked dicier things for sure, but I still feel that a company should completely knock a kickstarter out of the park —
@Thedeadlybutter I think with Kickstarter one has a responsibility to backers to prove, beyond ALL DOUBT, you’re good for it
Should Double Fine really be doing a second Kickstarter before the first one is fully delivered? I realize it’s different teams, but still.
@innismir and that’s 100% totally okay with me. The burden is on cops to be adults, not on children to be adults.
I really love @verge ! The way their web page crashes my iPad’s browser EVERY TIME has doubtlessly saved me hours of reading.
@focalintent so, about my program that calculates pi…
@innismir what you want to bet a 14yo had no concept that shrinking away from unwanted touch is “resisting an officer”?
@innismir I’m not impressed with police who feel the need to arrest every child who gives them lip. That’s all it comes down to.
@innismir and he insists he was busy holding a dog at the time, how else would his arms be? But that’s not very threatening in any case.
@innismir and the point is — IN AGGREGATE there is an endless deluge of stories like this; a pattern of police overreaction.
@innismir the police freely admit they tackled him because he tensed up and turned away. Not because he sprinted or punched them or w/e
@innismir yeah, and the correct response is “excuse me, we’re still talking here.”
@innismir I’m not die-hard anti-cop. I come from a cop family. But I’m sick of their “everyone is a threat at all times” attitude.
@innismir if they can produce evidence that he had a gun, a knife, or an armed drone, I’d be happy to consider he posed a threat to officers
@a_greenberg no name? Is this literally a sample?
@innismir I am far more concerned with what is right, just, and true, than what officers can squirm out of being reprimanded for.
@innismir that’s nice.
If you can’t react to a teenager shrugging you off in a calm and reasonable matter, you *REALLY* shouldn’t be a cop…
@landley yes…? That’s the point. The book on the right implies that Linux is “rare.”
The language used by the police officer to justify tackling a 14yo holding a puppy for “resisting” is terrifying http://t.co/2VtwzfnLS1

@QuantumG so when you sell the UI warns you that you're selling for 99% below average price but you're actually right on the money
@QuantumG in eve the "going price" for some cheap things is highly skewed by people trying to sell for way too much
Though the scams where they trade an item in exchange for your money AND your item seem to be largely the fault of a poor interface.
Example scam going on right now: "I'm selling for 600 isk each! Below local average!" Divide total by units, they're 6000 each. Duh.

@panther_modern @Private_Dev in my experience, in the US, in a class of 20 you'll probably have one or two cheaters, but only at 101 level
And yes, I both taken CS101 and TA'd it :)
@panther_modern @Private_Dev how common cheating is in CS actually depends very much on what country we're talking about
.@Private_Dev the sorts of students who cheat at CS 101 frequently show a startling inability to remember the structure w/o a template.
In this case it was an otherwise complete program that omitted "int main() {" and final "}". That would probably stump most CS 101 cheaters.
@puellavulnerata it's a completely 100% working answer. It just omits main() { } in an otherwise complete file with includes and all.

@8bitstatic in my case I had to run an efi recovery utility after Mint installed to put windows back on the boot list
@8bitstatic that laptop dual boots. If you get one with EFI instead of BIOS, do some googling to make sure your distro will dual correctly
Of course, I had to move to make the idea of not having a car viable. Don’t be both rural and a lover of technology.
@8bitstatic anyway I play Guild Wars 2 on low settings on my $300 laptop and it’s okay
@8bitstatic Skyrim is one of those games that’s a five-year benchmark :)
(Yes, I understand that if no one bought new cars, there wouldn’t be any used cars :p )
@angelXwind the VPN is completely separate from the wifi, it aggressively shuts down more than the wifi does.m
@8bitstatic for $500 you can get a laptop that will play most games, but not Skyrim and other very intensive ones

If you create "aux.exe" (one of the forbidden filenames) in cygwin then run it in cmd.exe, the error is that it violates your trust settings
@JZdziarski also, it would be 8 + 3 + no null terminator in a real dos implementation :)
@ColinTheMathmo well, I’m *trying* to break software, it’s just breaking before that software even runs :)
@JZdziarski it’s Cygwin.
@nullwhale true story: my cubemate @fredowsley tried very hard to light my ponies on fire with thermite.
@blowdart it's not my fault over twenty years of development wasn't enough to prepare Windows for me
cmd.exe has no idea what to do with this thing either.
@mof18202 cmd.exe doesn't get it either. But I somehow created this file in the first place
@vogon The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
So I can't delete it because it doesn't exist, but I can't create it because it already exists. That's... that's deep, Cygwin.
I think I broke Windows http://t.co/A3SzStVk5e (again)
Well I’ve discovered new and exciting ways to break the filename before bit9 even gets a chance to refuse to run it
@p0wnlabs it apparently does, as I get an error in the form of (primary name) (unicode square) (alternate stream name) is not approved
I’m probably the first person to ever complain of this: Cygwin’s bash doesn’t support autocomplete of NTFS alternate stream filenames!
@no_structure yes, but simply running them from in bash generates that bash did a no-no
@dangoodin001 clients like tweetbot support “mute” which omits their timeline tweets but not their mentions of you
Bizarrely, the ‘mv’ command in Cygwin triggers bit9 as me trying to execute the argument, but not ‘cp’
@apiary I can compile anything from source and run it but that’s cheating
Trying to break bit9 for sport. I feel like there must be a way to leverage the fact that Cygwin is approved

Am I a bad person if I poke conservative bronies like a science experiment to see what they say

@dipidoo I did buy actual sealing wax.

And yes, I stopped to take a picture of the USB port on fire before I put it out. http://t.co/5OR7lnlSxg
I lit the candle too well and fire dripped down with the wax and caught the plastic on fire. So, hypothesis remains untested
Hypothesis: it is safe to fill a USB port with hot wax. Result: I can't be trusted with anything ever. http://t.co/cs3YlIHTLm

I think the American public school system as we know it is absolutely horrible. The problem is what can we do that isn’t even more classist
@DrPizza and normally that’s fine, not everything is international news. But it adds a counter-perspective to shocking international news.

@nelhage the biggest game I’ve ever installed was 18GB uncompressed; that’s Guild Wars 2 and it’s HUGE and highly detailed
.@matt_merkle or $500/$600 or whatever the difference would be between “enough ram, enough HDD” and “wow definitely enough”
I guess it just comes down to I’d rather pay (hypothetical) $500 for a GREAT console than $400 for a decent one. But I’m not 12 either.
@ioerror … sigh
@ErrataRob @DrPizza I’ll keep that myth in mind next time I’m saving money buying in bulk
@washiiko 16GB would be enough for most games I am pretty sure.
@hackedy not sure if trolling or literal
@ErrataRob @DrPizza (I’m assuming bulk rates; I can’t quite get a single stick of 8GB ram delivered for $20 yet)
@ErrataRob @DrPizza I don’t think their target market is gonna say “look if it was $410 maybe but $430? Deal’s off”
@itsdapoleece assuming an intelligent paging mechanism, it doesn’t have to be all loaded for the game to start, can keep going in bg
@torvos @tapbot_paul I don’t think very many games even come remotely close to the hypothetical size limit
@tapbot_paul well I didn’t watch the announcement but apparently it’s coming with half a terabyte standard? I think that’s reasonable
@niallgdonaghy nope
@tenfootfangs I reckon. Who would spend the time to pick up a $3 game used?
You all have some very strong opinions on RAM
@itsdapoleece no different from now
@CastIrony they CAN, but the biggest games I own are 18GB on disc; throw in some room for growth
@DrPizza I doubt RAM is the make or break cost factor
@vogon I have, get on my level

@miuaf so that’s what Haskell is tainted by to me :p
@miuaf according to my sample size of one, Haskell programmers are dysfunctional stalkers who are clearly thinking about raping me
I don’t think professional programmers are “anti-academic” as much as they are “anti-implementing-is-not-my-problem”

@puellavulnerata nope, still counts. I just care that they don’t leave the default Windows/OSX wallpaper up :p
@puellavulnerata faster time to custom wallpaper == better. Actually wallpaper-sized image == better.
I judge new employees based on how quickly they set a custom wallpaper on their machine. And whether they stretch a too-small photo
Basically every single thing we suggest necessitates code change, review, and test on their end, so they all want to pare it down

@swb1192 @antifuchs I'm on 256-color mode on Windows 7 (and I can't read "cleartext", so it'd be disabled anyway)
@Jonimus yes, quite. I'm in 256-color mode over RDP to a powerful computer because it improves the framerate :)
SO MUCH FOR THAT PLAN http://t.co/CwC98WOmog

Apparently I managed to OOM my Windows machine over the weekend. I haven't done that since Windows 2000
I like how logging into a machine over RDP wakes up the monitor on it. As if the entire point wasn't to decouple the two.
@DrPizza yes, I suspect that is precisely their definition. Because all enterprises use IBM mainframes right

@donsalcedo eve
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h my dear friend just solved this. We are all Pangaeans.
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h it turns out the definition of continent depends entirely on who you're asking. Europe and Asia are not separate places...
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h in fact you call it Mexico in your profile. So I can call my country America for the exact same reason.
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h I really don't get it. I really don't. I doubt you refer to Mexico always as United Mexican States 100% of the time.
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h would you also jump down the throat of someone in the Republic of China calling their country Taiwan or China
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h I don't get what's so hard to understand of "people in (United States of) America refer to their country as America"
@c1tr1c @yaakov_h it's both, why can't it be both
@Phobos_11 @yaakov_h ....... *sigh* we. DO. share. Disclaimer: not speaking for the underbelly of American ignorance.
@Phobos_11 @yaakov_h ... .... .... wat
@Phobos_11 @yaakov_h ......?!?!?! It's our demonym! It is objectively our demonym. It's your... whatever you call a demonym for a continent
@Phobos_11 @yaakov_h sure, great, I don't dispute that.
Programmers always want names to be GUIDs because that's easier to deal with ;)
@cyclerunner it's our historical name. Names are messy, culturally rooted, and not GUIDs.
@vikphatak I think of America's "nicknames" as being like "Land of the Free" or "Droneland" or "Obamatown"
This rant brought to you by the one aspect on earth in which America doesn't get to play Chief Cultural Imperialist ;)
@0XiDi it's kind of like saying "Mister" is an integral part of "Mister John Smith" and incorrect to say "John Smith"
I've been to South America (Peru specifically). I love and embrace The Americas as in this together. Don't take my rant the wrong way &lt;3
@delroth_ it's exactly the same situation! Two places can have the same name. It's totally valid. Geographical names are not GUIDs
@delroth_ hahahahahahahahahaha  http://t.co/py8zRTNxiq  WRONG
"The United States of America" : "America" :: "People's Republic of China" : "China" &lt;-- stop being obtuse
@delroth_ which usually it's America being accused of but not this time
@delroth_ it doesn't matter. Fussing about what other countries call themselves is cultural imperialism
You all DO know that "the United States" just as well refers to Mexico, right? No, really. Look it up. Estados Unidos Mexicanos.
@vikphatak it's not a "nickname." No-one goes around saying United States of Mexico all the time. It's Mexico except in formal contexts
@delroth_ incidentally no-one in America (the country) calls the continent America. It is called NORTH America here.
@delroth_ I'm sure the FormerYugoslavRepublicOfMacedonians totally get your point.
@delroth_ what about it? All countries' legal documents use the fancy title like "Republic" or "Confederation"
@delroth_ WE. CALL. OUR. COUNTRY. AMERICA. "United States" is a description also used by Mexico for similar reasons.
@delroth_ Wow this is EXACTLY what I'm talking about  Who do you think knows what America's name is: Americans or not Americans
@TheEtherDotNet is it historically accurate within the cultural context? then yes || no.
@delroth_ Do you also call Mexico the United States? If not then the point falls flat.
@yaakov_h some people from Central/South American countries feel we don't have a right to use the word for our country
The fact that our country is called "America" does not invalidate the fact that your country is in The Americas. Both can be true.
Pet peeve: being told we can't call our country America because &lt;reason&gt;. Americans may be arrogant people but don't deny us our actual name
@m1sp you should get on a chat of some sort!!
@Ricky4fun North America and South America are continents. America is a country in North America. Its citizens are called Americans.

Also, I like that the "get started" button in the Dutch interface can be literally translated as "to the battle!" #excitableidioms
Of course, now Youtube thinks I'm British and I assume recommendations will start learning Dr. Who-ish.

Huh. Going to the British (not USA/generic) youtube domain fixed it back on the generic domain. Hello again, English! h/t @therulerofchina

@grp I can't even tell when you're trolling anymore
@artkiver no one is contesting a paying customer’s right to complain, only a not directly paying because it’s open source one.
@furicle no, but we all know those evil bakers are in on it somehow.
Another pet peeve of mine is “it’s open source so it’s your fault if you didn’t go to university to learn programming to patch it yourself”

@realnudel I love translucent terminals. I’d only not use one on a machine too weak to actually render that. Like, seventeen megahertz.
@mescyn then link to wherever the hell the rationale is. No rationale? Oh look I found the problem !!
@mescyn “it was removed because &lt;sensible reason&gt; and won’t come back because &lt;sensible reason&gt; sorry, &lt;suggested workaround&gt;” &lt;— good
@mescyn no rationale. User hostile.
@artkiver … that is the most “and this is what’s wrong with open source” comment imaginable ;)
@mescyn um, it’s like no one read the actual ticket and the actual response ! It’s the most straightforward non trolling ticket imaginable
@dhicynic @dylanmccall it isn’t ?
@elad3 open source has a social problem; success is contingent on not brewing community upsets like these
@elad3 yes, step 1. There’s an ordering dependency.
@elad3 I didn’t say they’re evil, just that no wonder folks say “my feature disappeared and GNOME is less useful to me now”
@elad3 Look at the actual ticket. Look at the actual response. All ranting came after that response.
Also, don’t miss the fact that GNOME is an actual foundation, with finances, not a hobby developer github account ;)
@elad3 but gnome is not a hobby project. They are a *foundation*. They have *money* and everything.
@elad3 valid argument for hobby side projects with a few thousand users or less!
@furicle that ticket is from a few weeks ago. Then someone posted it to HN and the fuss started. But it’s a righteous fussing IMO.
@elad3 @dotstdy what the feature is or how useless it was is completely tangential from the actual problem
I don’t care if it’s the stupidest feature in the history of the universe, that’s not professional behavior. End open source rant
@elad3 yes, I already read it
From the G+ thread: user is “irrationally attached” to feature that disappeared without explanation and devs wouldn’t give explanation.
@dotstdy @elad3 and… why not just like… say so?
Now, offering an actual rationale for why a feature was removed when someone opens a ticket (or linking to one) would be… better.
I don’t care that they’re “open source”, if they want to be a real project then they gotta not close “where did my feature go” with “no”
@elad3 strongly disagree. They are a *community* project. “No. *wontfix*” is completely anti-community
@dylanmccall … and sure it’s freeware, but it’s positioned as a serious product, ergo the users are customers.
@dylanmccall “where did my existing feature go?” “Wontfix” nope, that’s the most rude-to-customers thing a programmer can possibly do

@demize95 I’ll let you in on a secret: I have a compulsion to acquire tech every few months.  Far better that I spend $60 than $600 :D
@zeroday not necessarily this one in particular but http://t.co/927khBoPo0
@_larry0 no wifi, almost certainly, but a lot of them actually fit ethernet in there!
@iRonNCSU well, the screen itself, plus wifi
I am seriously considering getting one of these ~$60 netbooks in the interest of science and brightly colored plastic casing
It’d be a lot of fun to get a stack of these and give them out as prizes at a con and see if anyone can do something with them
@McGrewSecurity that one is a speed demon compared to the 300mhz one I just found
Where do these incredibly terrible netbooks even come from? http://t.co/927khBoPo0
@bobpoekert keyboards are kind of noted for being easy to enumerate all states for working as expected!
@superMTW no, it's for the generic bluetooth keyboard
@JZdziarski @cschweitz I'm just saying I don't see how the response was in any way related to racist prejudice on a personal level

@grp which is what Windows has been literally our entire lives. If they can solve the app problem, WinRT won’t be a waste of a tablet anymor
@grp fundamentally the issue is that it *currently* fails to be a Windows- a general purpose home office and school platform w/ apps galore

@grp it’s just like Windows 8, except without the “Windows” part! And a ghost town app store; RT should not YET exist on its own.
@vogon Windows doesn’t even have x86/x64 fat binaries afaik. That’s so embarrassing
@vogon well, yes.  “Shooting your future self in the foot: a biography of Microsoft”
@grp the iPad isn’t a continuation of a product line on which my business’s applications were based?
@vogon I just very strongly feel that there should have been an intermediate step - that WinRT shouldn’t even exist yet.
@vogon that’s an “if” larger than the moon, and it’s panning out exactly as it was foretold

@artkiver twitter explicitly bans unicode in handles. The question is how the Arabic-speaking kid bugged it out.

@artkiver um, no one denies that *real names* have always supported unicode. Your twitter handle is @artkiver .

@CDA @mikko where might I find this certificate installer?
@elad3 @0x3a @mikko it does a soft check client side but lets me submit, then the server either returns an error or silently rejects it
As best as I can figure, twitter has/had a bug with normalizing a unicode percent sign to ASCII and not escaping it, lulz ensued
@elad3 @mikko @0x3a I’m betting there is/was a bug where that was normalized to an ASCII % and not escaped
@mikko @elad3 @0x3a I bet it has something to do with that fancy unicode percent, ٪ , but I still can’t repro.
@JZdziarski @CDA Chrome allows arbitrary sites to register for pinning, especially google. And Twitter official apps definitely use it
Seems the unicode girl’s profile is no accessible on web. Not sure if they fixed bug or I just can’t repro @mikko http://t.co/hSXCsYecMV
@JZdziarski @CDA and pinning has been widely implemented as a direct response to Iran’s abuse in the past
@JZdziarski @CDA of course, but the cert would still be *different* than it was before, and that can’t defeat pinning
@mattblaze I just quoted the guy and let it stand- but my gut tells me it’s either true or they want us to think it’s true and “behave”.
@kivikakk @m1sp good noon &lt;3
@marginoferror @mikko she used to have an ASCII username so I am betting the validation bug is in username *change* code somewhere
@elad3 @mikko no I tried that too. Perhaps relevant is that it keeps giving me the mobile site in English after I set profile to Arabic?
@JZdziarski @CDA you can’t “not know” about being asked to install a new root CA. It’s not a silent operation on any OS.
.@mikko I can’t figure out how she(?) did it- I registered an account, set it to Arabic, and tried to change my username, no repro
@NaveedHamid @mikko that’s just about UI translation. Can’t figure out what this girl(?) did- I can’t register a handle with Arabic chars

@kragen .... others are telling me I'm off-base to consider a language with classes "object oriented"
@kragen stuff like len(list) instead of list.count or similarly named member variable. Like, you call that object oriented?
@bobpoekert it's... not as object-orienty as I was led to believe?
Language defenders stand down! I don't hate python. I just keep having to look stuff up because it doesn't work as I assume.
@zephyrfalcon I'd expect "no. of elements in list" to be something like list.count or list.size. Apparently it's len(list)

@tapbot_paul not to *use* anyway! The spirit of the comment was to teach the taste of abject failure.

@greg311 okay then I’m not sure what we’re disagreeing on
@dfranke the prior is kind of too likely to lead to the other. Don’t teach small kids to use death machines. Small kids are dumb.
@greg311 my cousin-kid doesn’t get to use real guns yet but there are real guns in his general vicinity and they’re glamorized to him
@greg311 I’m just saying that in some families teaching small children to use guns is seen as dead normal
@SurprisingEdge I’m fairly sure that’s where the actual cart makes contact (the cartridge housing has been removed)

@uppfinnarn in this case I was talking to someone targetting Wii and it turns out the stack is measured in tens of kilobytes haha
@uppfinnarn and modern compilers may try to warn you when they can detect that you're unambiguously going to blow it
@uppfinnarn it can cause bizarre memory corruption but if you're compiling against a modern x86/x64 the stack is fairly large
Q: How can I know when my C program is going to exhaust the stack? A: It's platform-dependent and arbitrary! Have fun.
@Manawyrm donno, but I have found a project that suits my ideal for the moment, if I need another I will check if audacity is native enough
@Manawyrm well, Firefox is a little too big for what I have in mind, but I assumed that it has a Unixy layer in there somewhere

@DarrenPMeyer huh… they didn’t have that when I needed them!
@DarrenPMeyer afaik there is no amazon basics lightning cable? That one is fraying too.
Oh look another super overpriced apple cable fraying at the base of the connector which I’ve never seen any other USB cable do
@eevee I’m crying IRL for Styx. Your enthusiasm for him made me totally reconsider my opinion of hairless cats.

@landley well, I’m not about to spend the next month of my life hex editing the app to save to local storage
@smeerp I wish one could flag a tweet as “question answered thanks”
@fuzztester that’s not how you twitter ;)
@thorsheim I work with highly sensitive customer 0days on a daily basis, I can’t be dumping my notes to cloud servers
There are a lot of cool little note apps and whatnot that I would totally use if *they didn’t have cloud storage you can’t turn off*
@bpblack I was being slightly sarcastic ;)
@ternus oops, hang on, thought I turned that off
@csoandy @ternus be a pal and help me fill in some words in this recording where it didn’t come through clearly
@ternus @csoandy is it a wireless mic by any chance? :3

My avatar apparently polls very highly with the “twelve and under” constituency
@AtheistLoki for the record I’m not in the habit of attending events which are targeted specifically at my gender though
@AtheistLoki yes but sometimes it’s “a problem caused by a few jerks” and sometimes it’s “institutionalized prejudice”
@AtheistLoki the bitterness may occasionally leak.
@AtheistLoki my entire life story has been that of being pressured to “tone down” or outright conceal my gender if I want to be “accepted”
@AtheistLoki my entire life story has been that of being pressured to “tone down” or outright conceal my gender if I want to be “accepted”
@AtheistLoki ever been a woman at a predominantly male conference? Ever been told to stop dressing/talking like a girl because it’s weird
@AtheistLoki that there’s no such thing as predominantly male conferences? Sarcasm Town.

@addelindh @csoandy anonymous remailer server. They want the logs so of course they just seize the machine.
@ternus situational irony, get with the times
@csoandy I’m referring to email servers being seized because of a bomb threat sent to a university
@ternus @timapril why would you do that
Sounds like it’s a generational thing re: calling in bombs. Modern terrorists have no manners.
I’m being flooded with answers that the IRA does this. I’m clearly Irish by blood only.
@PwnieExpress you know… posting bitly links with no context makes you look owned.
Has there ever been a “bomb threat” which was followed up with an actual bomb?
@comex America is definitely not the worst country on the internet but don’t fall into complacency 😤
@comex they’ve granted retroactive immunity to companies that facilitated illegal wiretapping, etc
@comex yeah except they’re just going to try and try and try again with slightly different bills broken into smaller pieces
@mescyn Iran ******
@mescyn especially since Google started pushing the concept of pinning after Iraq tried something like this
@mescyn they probably do, but you can’t just arbitrarily replace Verisign and Thawte certs of major sites and expect to not get caught

@comex I count the US as a censorship country, just not nearly as far gone as obvious candidates like China and Iran
@vogon I’m talking about ways to arrest an unpopular-with-government person on a technicality
@vogon you’ve seen the proposals to start taxing it right? But I’m bit talking about caring about bitcoin itself
The fact that arbitrary stuff can be encoded into blockchain is just begging for a censoring gov to arrest bitcoin users for distributing CP
@techbytom it’s a (non-scientific) poll, not a statistic :)
@pzmyers @AtheistLoki gosh, a conference where most attendees are men or pressured to act more mannish to fit in? Unheard of!
@maradydd @travisgoodspeed in the mean time it’s a glaring attack vector to enable governments to nab people on a technicality
@techbytom but that’s what’s on the table - possibility of legal repercussions/fines for failure to facilitate wiretap.
We’re not as collectively trusting as it may seem sometimes http://t.co/XraCBULdo2

Nothing like an incredibly vivid nightmare to start the day
@no_structure I’d like to think this is a current screenshot, and it thinks you want those guys so bad you’ll buy a 2008 calendar to get em.

@MarioVilas so I just noticed your name in this code...
.@glyph ah, I found the problem: # by 0xabad1dea 2013
@glyph gremlins. Gremlins everywhere.
@ColinTheMathmo a parser called pefile... first I wasted a lot of time trying to 2to3ify it.. gave up... random errors... now it works.
@ColinTheMathmo well for the record, my program is literally *one line long* at the moment - all these problems have been peripheral.
@ColinTheMathmo also why do you assume I'm not trying to learn python
@ColinTheMathmo my problem isn't python. It's modules causing frustrating error messages when I try to import them.
.@MarioVilas oh, NOW it works. So you know what? I have no earthly idea what was causing the error. *headdesk*
@rantyben I'd be writing this in Ruby if I thought it were more practical...
.@MarioVilas "exe = pefile.PE("file.exe")" does not work, "pe = pefile.PE("file.exe")" does... it is beyond my mortal ken why.
@chriseng libraries...
omfg python why does the success of finding the class hinge on what I name the variable I assign it to this is terrible
Looks like I may have to give up on Python 3 entirely and use Python 2. Come *on*.
@Brian_Sniffen nope, uninteresting to me :p
@yacCz however it wants? Any internally consistent behavior is fine... I just don't want a hard error for a pedantic warning.
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation - Python it's really astounding you think igaf
I'm so glad 2to3.py doesn't rewrite string.lowercase to string.ascii_lowercase, it really improves my day to do it by hand.
@cirdan12 false analogy

@DrPizza my cat (who now lives with my mother) generally hates being touched.
@lukegb that's the point!
@geekable You can even play fort mode, retire your fort, start adventure mode and go plunder it
@Saturn500Jared I play far too slowly to livestream. I'm often doing other things at the same time.
@geekable there's adventure mode which plays like nethack except across a world with towns and npcs who might come with you as meat shields
Hmm... next time I play DF, I should make a tumblr for liveblogging it, to avoid generating ten thousand tweets about wooden artifacts
@theROPfather nope
There outta be a law against "shuffle mode" in music players that doesn't remember what nodes it's already visited
@garlimidon I suspect you're biased ;) actually I like Fire Emblem, but I'm not very good at it.
@sergeybratus haven't heard of it actually
And I love games like Dwarf Fortress because the complex simulation interacts with imagination to create rich narrative on the fly
@sergeybratus however, the puzzles themselves did not really hold my attention, though I recall trying to brute force a few.
@sergeybratus Myst has a narrative - I was 7yo the last time I played it but I remember the letter to Catherine clearly.
I've never enjoyed puzzle games, board games, and card games, as they generally lack narrative/character with motivation
@DanielFairchild that's the joke ;) this thing is terrible.
@LowestCommonDen and the 10s.
@themarkcaudill alternatively, look at a block of text and partially cross your eyes, letters that stand out need work.
@themarkcaudill did you try adjusting the spacing (don't be afraid to put the edges of letters over the left baseline)

I've heard "gonna forge your signature" from several people but my "real" handwriting is not very font-friendly.
@Strongdave depends on the definition of "precious" you suppose me to be using :)
@lukegb I have genuinely never once seen a font that exhibits the procedural characteristics of my handwriting
@CafieroCarlo http://t.co/C51mR8ljMj but the joke was malicious TTF files
@lukegb good luck, as I can't possibly express my actual handwriting in TTF
Oh these apps in the security section of the Windows 8 store are just precious
So how many of you installed my handwriting TTF? No reason just wondering. 😇
Apparently Norton has a free app that will scan my twitter timeline for malicious links. Joke's on them I distribute these on purpose!
I'm installing a free Windows 8 password manager that uses unspecified "best encryption techniques". We shall see...
@verticalblank my brother and husband are perplexed why I refuse to play it anymore frankly a decade of losing is sour...
@verticalblank it's balanced towards something I don't have because I have never once in my life won Mario Party
@_booto ... why? You're just trying to drag an analogy too far...
@_booto three strikes does not end the game, it ends the turn
@_booto but my point is that a lot of early games were designed for maximum quarter expenditure not maximum enjoyment
@_booto I can't think of any outside of permadeath a la D&amp;D which is "gritty realism"
(Or used to cover up the fact that the game itself was about an hour long.)
Games are "too easy" these days because they give you infinite lives? Finite lives was an invention for pay-per-play arcade games, you know.
@rantyben @cyclerunner @ErrataRob I'm glad this resolved itself while I was busy watching Mario Party videos.
@_larry0 @spacerog as long as it’s one of those camps with electrical hookups! Magfest did this and it was a lot of fun
@da_667 if so, only to avoid having to write correct AI for so many different games…
Watching more “Luigi Does Nothing” videos, my negative feelings towards Mario Party are confirmed. Too many minigames not enough playtesting
@ternus jay-z just how far did you go
@justinschuh you be good to him!
@wimremes wasn’t me!
@_____C oh, you misunderstand - there’s no such thing as a minimum wage programmer afaik. I’m talking threat model.
@_____C on the whole they’re not familiar with words like “misgendering” so I wouldn’t interpret that as a literal quote ;)
@_____C anyway it’s 2am and I’ve reached my burnout point :)
@_____C they’re people who went out of their way to tell me to be quiet and take being misgendered like a man. I don’t owe politeness
@_____C they’re not my friends, I don’t have to handle their feelings delicately
@pokemon_ebooks does Johto have no laws on tampering with historical artifacts?
@_____C this whole thing was in *response* to people so I didn’t have to address them all individually.
@_____C I did try to mention repeatedly that it's subconscious / unintentional most of the time. But that doesn't make it okay.
@grp just as long as you don't species-deny any craftsquid.
@grey_area those are quirks rather than underlying grammar. It's not a parse error to call a boat an it.

@bobpoekert @bhelyer now there is a tweet I can get behind, regardless of context.
@comex of course it's silly, I'm just trying to drive the point home
@comex if I ever need a cool lady to hire as an iOS hackette, I'll let you know, ma'am.
@comex way to be an ally
@comex it's your convenience to feel that way... as it doesn't really affect you.
@comex because it feels like they couldn't waste the nanoseconds it would take to use inclusive language because who cares right
@comex what do you say to the idea that I really am personally offended when I look at a job opening I'm interested in and I see "he"?
@tanonev officer? idk I have mixed feelings on them to begin with
@comex I'm not sure if you're using "that" to mean "I think that" "tumblr is stupid" or "I think this particular tumblr" "is stupid" -- ah
@segfault314 the "radical" may or may not be dripping with sarcasm
@bhelyer Sense of "adult male" is late (c.1000); &lt;-- over a thousand years ago is a definition of "late *early* English" :)

@benwmaddox other people have asked me the same question and it seems to come down to "not really".
@tufts_cs_mchow @523 yup
@ErrataRob it's a) a huge portion of repliers b) making fun of someone without attribution does not imply making fun of EVERYONE.
@longobord @maradydd @sergeybratus then you use it as an adjective, a fellow person, and, more subjectively, "engineering fellows" or w/e
@ErrataRob I'm just repeating the mansplainers :)
@longobord @maradydd @sergeybratus "guy" is kind of like "fellow" in that respect
So, "craftsman" is gender-neutral because a) historically all-male academic organizations say so b) it's shorter. Good to know.
Where's my radical feminist badge huh
@miuaf I just figured you were a meowth with a lisp.
@TomSellers @csoandy I weep for the loss of manly concision. How I long for the days when men were men and women were men 'cuz it's shorter!

@sergeybratus I'm exempting non-native speakers from rigorous Not Offending Me, don't worry.
@ternus I'm definitely a downvote on "chick" but only because I usually only hear it used as "So some chick &lt;something annoying&gt;"
@ternus I also accept "girl" as I look/act/think quite young :p
@ternus I prefer to be referred to with terms such as seneschal and harbinger
Brilliant analogy via @miuaf whose handle I someday hope to learn to pronounce http://t.co/AJ2cJ4sUz2
@miuaf @thegrugq oh bloody brilliant I was just trying to think of how to fit in an analogy like that into a tweet...
If you think man/guy/dude is not a gendered word, there's about a 99.95% chance it's your gender.
@thegrugq @Dan2552 what consensus? There's only consensus if you just ignore all the people complaining about being misgendered
@thegrugq um, okay, so? It isn't a word because of historical oppression of women seeking alternative employment to housewifery
@Dan2552 @thegrugq I mean would you be okay with just calling everyone a craftswoman and telling guys that's not gendered
@Dan2552 @thegrugq No offense but that's because craftsmen used to be all men and men often don't stop and think about the implications
.@thegrugq the point is people carelessly use gendered terms without considering how absurd it'd be to use the inversion.
@theROPfather my schools had men as teachers? But that's still misogyny if a man is shamed for acting womanly.
@send9 I prefer "they" but some people believe that English is in some kind of stasis and that's Bad Grammar.

@Tomi_Tapio @BenLaurie except that’s so stunningly ineffective that you are just wasting everyone’s time and money

@grp well, Google is pushing it as a flagship product so it’s embarrassing it’s two major releases behind

@mister_borogove as in, I have played against humans who lost all 5 lives to getting caught under the stage as in the last clip. Stage wins.
@mister_borogove they did patch that up quite a bit in the sequel; but players do that a lot too on the stages they chose for the demo.
@mister_borogove and clearly, the AI is reactive, so the player is not giving it input and it just does whatever
@mister_borogove this game has been poked and prodded for a decade. They carefully aligned matches with specific variables to cause this
How on earth did "human resources" become the unironic, accepted term
@jesster_king you assume OP is a good man!
Hmm, I guess the "anonymous" complaints are routed through a third party who transcribes them - I guess that's close enough.
@invalidname @mojinations California? Never heard of it.
@mojinations this is about fraud etc. not harassment, actually - not that there's any incidents of such so far that I'm aware of
@Neostrategos consider if a man with a swoon-worthy Polish accent filed a tip...
@mojinations guess I'm a stickler for "anonymous" in the cryptographically secure sense
Anyone see a problem with an "anonymous concern phone number" for a company with &lt;= 200 employees?

@raudelmil six bitcoins!
@blowdart I don't say it THAT much!
@deepthoughts10 @netbus @mikko the whole system is actually a complete train wreck that's massively insecure
@ternus no he's gay
I'm kind of freaked out by Windows 8's auto suggest. I type "he is" it pops up "bisexual"

@Netbus yes that, they could ie pretend to be Google or a bank. Not that they would do that as people would find out and be furious

@whitequark so when I hear “I don’t know any girls who are good at computers” followed by being called a boy, you see why I’m upset
@whitequark (the literal meaning is to paint a naturally brown fence white, we use it idiomatically a lot)
@whitequark in this context I meant ignoring non-white contributors to history or portraying them as white (ie Jesus)
@mescyn @Neostrategos not a lot of comments on those; it was my Nexus 7 video
@nelhage I decided I don’t like being called a boy more than I don’t like being called a slut or whatever.
@whitequark especially since I’m a minority in my field, it feels like the gendered version of white washing.
@whitequark imagine if people constantly addressed you as ma’am and lady and little girl. I’m assuming you’re not gender fluid.
I need to get the NES video from @Neostrategos so I can have something on my YouTube where not one single person will call me a guy

@ternus implying that if I google-stalk long enough I can find pics of you with a ponytail?
@ternus collars. Short hair. Polite manner. Pretty weird, dude
@ternus also did you know you look like a government kid
@ternus I am super sketchy. I am defined by many short overlapping lines
@ternus yes there is nothing typical about that childhood btw did I tell you about the time the Foreign Service didn’t hire me
@ternus rural children have much more free reign. Suburban parents are typically disproportionately paranoid, using urban as their model.
@ternus I think you’ll find a strong correlation with urban, suburban, rural.

Just read a good point I hadn’t thought of - it’d be cheaper for Intel to prop up AMD than to deal with monopoly regulation hell.
@themarkcaudill hahaha

@themarkcaudill well consider this, Mark. Didn’t I already lead this tweet with your name o_O

.@wgragido because of the fake bombing news or…?
@panther_modern some Syrian gang is taking credit but just as likely they’re just skiddies trying to get free attention
@panther_modern I doubt it, as average time to detection of silent compromises is, like, months to over a year.
*sniffle* Why did @rantyben call me a thought leader? I thought we were friends!
Say, what’s your procedure for reacting to phishes sent to your people? Probably a good time to double-check.
@ra6bit @donicer wouldn’t walkie talkies work better anyway though?
@quine @rantyben @osxreverser yeah I like you too Zach.
@getwired @marshray someone from AP says there was a phishing incident one hour before the breach…
If it’s true that AP was targeted by a competent phishing attack, then that tweet probably had more intent behind it than lulz.
@rantyben @SamHananelAP ouch, now that was uncalled for!
@rantyben @SamHananelAP on that timescale that’s significant - extrapolate if news that it was a hack hadn’t gotten out quickly…

@AutismIsakiller you heard about the guy in the hospital who woke up and wanted to see footage to point out who did it right

@innismir there are three radio towers in a marsh tucked between the mall and Network Drive
I can't shake the feeling that someone, somewhere, is trying to use @J_tsar's twitter data as a basis for account profiling
@WeismanBen I wasn't able to figure out why they're there, it might just be filming.
"Ortiz has faced criticism for coming down too hard on some defendants, but that approach may become an asset..." Oh buzz off
Well at least it's confirmed they're trying him as a citizen and not an "enemy combatant" so those senators can suck on a yucky lollipop
@JastrzebskiJ all I know is the bottom is yellow and I think the top was dark blue. They're repeatedly circling the area very VERY low.
They buzzed our office but I can't find anything wrt the police looking for someone. Maybe they're just filming the majestic suburban wilds
@ternus Built before everyone and their uncle carried laptops and phones. Can't be bothered to change.
@rockhopper that was the best I could do from the car
This helicopter is circling outside the Burlington Mall http://t.co/3SZeiOJKHP
Should I be concerned about the helicopter practically buzzing the grass I just saw down the street
.@puellavulnerata can you imagine: "we're picking up the signature of a Nintendo 3DS! This plane is grounded until it's secured!"
@puellavulnerata I would never enable the TSA to be more annoying, but they totally would buy this ...
The winky face is key to interpreting that tweet, y'all
Namely he wants me to patent my technique for identifying suspicious consumer devices like Kindles and sell it to the TSA for zillions ;)
My husband just told me not to tweet something because I should patent it first. I think he's evil
@giovannibajo lol that wasn't what I meant at all :p I meant the typing
Peace is when a temple invites members of another religion to hold ceremonies inside because their church building is unavailable...
@Jonimus well that's what all this Science(tm) is about :)
@ra6bit that OSX Lion supports? :p
They run at the same mhz, but the ram in my macbook and my work laptop have completely different noise profiles :)
@jesster_king she got engaged and she's dropping out of college to get married sooner
@aquavitaecoll yeah but you can just change the strings from "intel" and "intel 64-bit" to "32-bit" and "64-bit" much cleaner
Am I allowed to be bitterly judgmental if my cousin just fell right into the MRS Degree hole? I'm self-righteous I know but come on
@davidwees @ezchili anyway I think you will find this interesting - my 10th grade history book http://t.co/XqDYtlr3OX
My grandmother just sent me a text longer than the iPhone screen how does she manage that she doesn't even have a smartphone
@yyr_ haha I can tell you're not a Mac person ;)
Everyone: I am aware of the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit processes. The "Intel" part is completely superfluous :p
@davidwees @ezchili But if I had to condense what "saved my soul" to one tweet: Astronomy. Not just books, telescopes.
@davidwees @ezchili turns out my core beliefs were actually incredibly stupid when compared to unfiltered reality! but that's the problem...
I'm confused why Activity Monitor in OSX still notates that every single process is of Intel type when the PPC emulation is gone
@davidwees @ezchili oh, I knew from age 6 that Satan's agents said so ;) that is a very long and painful story actually.
THE NINJAS FOUND ME TELL MY BEST FRIEND I --- oh hello third-floor window cleaners
@Abzol you know we agree right? :p
@Abzol that’s the point - people try to deny terror suspects (even the most tenuous maybe-suspects) basic human rights
When human rights don’t apply to someone because they’re bad, remember, someone out there thinks you’re bad.
Hit video game from Veracode: Where in the world is @chriseng San Diego?
@41414141 they’re installing tor, obviously
@davidwees @ezchili there are private schools that teach this. I went to one.
@_larry0 @ternus I think my TSA lady was upset I wanted to do it in full view of the line. Told her three times, nope, here's good, thanks.
@ternus except last time I went through they were so not wanting to touch me that I could have fit a whole soda can (dangerous stuff, soda)
@Abzol passing a raw get or post variable to the system shell
Reviewing the stuff I recorded at Source and I have no idea what talk could have been talking about a model trainset
@nullwhale well for starters, I can't overwrite all 4GB with a new value sixty times a second like you can a screen :)
I can track the exact moment the machine goes into hibernation well after the screen is off
@grayj_ 800mhz because the reported speed of the ram is 1600mhz. My other devices have 1333/665-ish
@grayj_ tuning my radio on AM to 800 MHz and holding the antenna in the same plane as the RAM over it
Got a recording of the MacBook's RAM #AdventuresInTempest https://t.co/9H5wkrOvX8
@fredowsley welcome back. You missed the fireworks.
@skyeyemachine there's a pretty pattern centered on the mhz of my tablet's RAM that appears on my radio when I lay the antenna on the screen
@send9 I went to radio shack and picked up a generic bunny ears plus the PAL adapter for it (they had it in a baggie on the wall)
@rjsalts kinda sorta!
@send9 yes. If it’s staticky it’s because of your location / antenna.
Hit the deck! It’s TEMPEST! http://t.co/sPHkvHa5Tv
Hmm... do you suppose it's a coincidence I can pick up a faint beautiful pattern centered exactly on the speed of my RAM? :)
All these frequency analysis graphs are giving me the finger
Hamming window hanning window is this a cruel joke

@dakami casual * curse you autocorrect
@dakami whereas with DH it was a causal friendship that grew over several years

Ever read an article on some aspect of psychology and realize they’re reading your mind http://t.co/GKLmPDcDjC  This is embarrassing
Re: the guy who thought he was a government bank security tester- incredibly naive. Incredibly lucky to have gotten out of that mess okay.
@VZDBIR you need an anime character avatar
@PatrickAK maybe, but I feel like I probably shouldn’t be trusted with a transmitter :)
@puellavulnerata I’m just relieved the cops actually kept their heads screwed on. It’s practically a miracle.
@puellavulnerata and I haven’t been able to determine why they did so at this house in particular
@puellavulnerata I’m aware of one shady looking thing - one house where they demanded everyone come out with their hands up
@puellavulnerata and some people said “no” when the cops knocked on their door and they didn’t dispute it
@puellavulnerata I’m just not aware of any cases of people being harassed for being outside except when gunfire was in the immediate area
@savagejen @dan_crowley @puellavulnerata so did I! We could all hear on the radio where he was by that point :)
@puellavulnerata I’m just saying that the “lockdown” was almost entirely voluntary in who participated and I broke it multiple times
@puellavulnerata @savagejen no, it’s impossible to get four million people to totally agree on literally anything
@puellavulnerata @savagejen this is what happened: “please stay inside” “sure” said most people “nah” said a few and nothing happened
@puellavulnerata @savagejen the trains were closed but there were people outside everywhere
@puellavulnerata @savagejen you know that’s not what I’m saying, and that didn’t happen anyway
@puellavulnerata @savagejen it’s difficult to describe, but to us locals this terror attack was intensely personal, not “just” violence
@puellavulnerata @savagejen — but on the whole, Boston wanted them there and they did what Boston wanted them to do
@puellavulnerata @savagejen I’m not going to assert they did everything 100% right as thousands of people were involved —
@puellavulnerata the search actually wasn’t nearly as invasive as twitter thought. On the whole they actually remembered to knock and ask.
@puellavulnerata the entire city never shut down. I was there. It didn’t happen.
@0x17h chiptune ain’t midi yo
@savagejen Trying to decide if this is a pun or you haven’t noticed all the boys I’ve been hitting on over twitter :p
@0x17h chiptune privilege: watching this and thinking “well duh”
@savagejen what does that make a dry atheist
@m1sp @JackLScanlan I’m struggling to imagine why they care, but who am I kidding
@_larry0 today in “images that make no sense in thumbnail view”
@spacerog “hmm, I could totally copy paste that 140 times. No, I won’t, I won’t be that obnoxious”
Leave it to the FBI to screw up good intentions
@m1sp incidentally I’ve been feeling really limerent
@m1sp I think you are the only person who has caused me to look things up in the dictionary in the past year
@m1sp are you breaking Microsoft’s heart
@gsuberland geez he went right back to eating his pizza they’re not 100% overreactive 100% of the time :p
Achievement unlocked: got a funny look from a cop re: my touchscreen radio
Not getting criticism on BBC that Suspect 2 is "only" 19yo and hence not dangerous. That's an adult. And near his physical prime.
Awesome if I unplug the antenna and touch my finger to the connector I can pick up FM music with my body
@themarkcaudill not yet but I will.
@dildog I'm not talking about overpopulation due to completely open doors, I mean being fearful of foreigners on principle
@ErrataRob and I think it's easy to forget how RECENT these events which changed the city's demographics are
@ErrataRob ie I have photographs of my Irish-Bostonian ancestors. My father grew up speaking Italian to his friends in a Boston suburb.
@ErrataRob what do you think the dot dot dot is for   I was focusing on Boston's relatively recent waves of profound effect
If there is anyone in Boston who is now anti-immigrant ask them if their last name is Irish, Italian, Greek, ....
Taking my radio to the big city taught me a lot about what various signals I can pick up are actually for as they go live more often
@GabrielGumbs I'm genuinely unsure and want to know more. But I do know the title on the YouTube vid is misleading ...
@GabrielGumbs I'm not going to assert not one single act of disrespect by the cops happened, however.
@GabrielGumbs and almost all of them, it was show up, nope not him, leave
@GabrielGumbs I was listening to the police radio - lots of valid reasons for checking specific places due to the emergency popped up.
"One time our web scanner found a button to send faxes and hammered it. Then there are the FUN customers..."
@themarkcaudill yes, yes, and yes, but as if they got in trouble...
@themarkcaudill it's happened several times. They gave some hick rednecks a fake bomb and arrested them when they planted it
@themarkcaudill just that she claims this is another case of the FBI enabling a wannabe. Ofc just as likely she’s desperate for an excuse
@chort0 I’ve been to the Chinese embassy - to my surprise they totally owned up to some stuff when political science students asked
@matthew_d_green I’m trying to decide if this is a subdivision of bitcoins joke or… http://t.co/IUIwdPwhmW
@secmoose @0x17h @skry @radleybalko I’m not sure why that house got searched, unless it’s because it’s several adults no kids
@secmoose @0x17h @skry @radleybalko everyone I’ve found a quote from said that, in context, they didn’t feel violated;
@garywhitta @vogon oh look another children’s movie starring a young man, several assorted male characters, and exactly one woman. Yaaaaay.
At least one case of SWAT team frisking everyone in a house in Watertown- not sure if they had a specific reason. http://t.co/ElRsp1anyN
@0x17h @soycamo I have no idea what’s going on here but not having her hair up is against regulation
@ra6bit presumably gotten out of hand if true. Or she could just be desperate for an excuse
@ra6bit she says it’s another case of the FBI shepherding wannabes until there’s enough to make an arrest
@m1sp you are my ally angel
Time to close the tab: “Dope-smoker Dzhokhar” Yeah I’m sure that’s relevant
@Jedi_Amara that’s sexist.  Also all but one of the divine messengers in the Bible are explicitly male or ungendered.
@HyShai I doubt they would have wanted an actual explosion if this was their game. But it’s too soon to know either way
@puellavulnerata @HyShai oh yeah bingo. The one where the feds gave them a dud bomb so they could be arrested for trying to use it
Can someone with a better memory than me remind me and @HyShai of times the govt has aided a potential terrorist so they can make an arrest
@HyShai there’s a chance it’s true as they’ve done something like that before. Or she may be desperate for a reason her sons aren’t evil
@HyShai she says this is another case of the FBI enabling a potential terrorist so they have someone they can arrest
The mother is naturally an emotional wreck right now, but if her allegations against the FBI are true, there best be hell to pay
@puellavulnerata @jeremiahfelt @Asher_Wolf okay, just finding the news articles on her claims now… interesting…
@puellavulnerata @jeremiahfelt @Asher_Wolf we’ll have to wait that one out then since obviously she’s probably not at her emotional best
@jeremiahfelt @Asher_Wolf @puellavulnerata the alternative is Keeping Lists based solely on immigration status and we do not want that.
@jeremiahfelt @Asher_Wolf @puellavulnerata also does not seem to be the case? They checked the elder in 2011 I think and found nothing
@Asher_Wolf @puellavulnerata rather someone at the hospital ID’d who had left the bag on the ground from footage
@Asher_Wolf @puellavulnerata there’s no evidence the FBI knew who they were looking for “the entire time” that I’ve seen
@themarkcaudill I expected a quite ordinary looking person. I’m just bothered by the cognitive dissonance of “he’s… he looks like my type”
@m1sp good noon &lt;3
@themarkcaudill that’s not quite what I mean no…
@Hyder_Khan yup I’m Dutch-born. Nah don’t worry, “they” know where my loyalties lie :)
@Twirrim just scared, and decided to kidnap someone for their car and tell them they were the bombers? Come on :p
@Twirrim at this point there’s simply no plausible doubt. He wasn’t bleeding to death in a stranger’s boat for fun
I can’t help but be astounded at all the basic, obvious steps they could have taken to avoid being caught. Hooray for catching The Dumb.
@geekable you’re trying so hard
@WhiteMageSlave maybe if Timmy put on a hundred pounds
http://t.co/RGaUEqRSUM I’m bothered by what a beautiful boy he is
Gods dammit America this is why we can’t have nice things http://t.co/puNuHIVvKo could you just STOP SHOOTING PEOPLE
@ternus but where is the silly pic of you inside? Bor-RING
@CyborgCode http://t.co/TnIcgPJZ5p
@Hyder_Khan but it may be a cultural thing that we consider gun violence and bomb violence to be totally different and the latter far worse.
@Hyder_Khan no charges have been brought yet, something can be “investigated as” a terror incident and changed later because of evidence
@FrederickGeek8 like I have a pebble! I was Poor(tm) during the Kickstarter
.@edropple yes, I just wanted to acknowledge that some people near the gunfire were, in fact, temporarily restrained by the police
@rjsalts @thegrugq because we take everything personally
@rjsalts @thegrugq just wrote a ridiculously long musing on this http://t.co/sP0FRN9rhZ it will *never* be common in Boston
Counterpoint, accounts of ppl who were particularly close to the gunfire and told more firmly to stay put http://t.co/f7EfYjWRXO via @ternus
@dfranke so, I think the call to shelter in place was the correct decision even if theoretically he may have been found sooner otherwise
@dfranke and if he had come out sooner, the kid might have been conscious enough to shoot him. It’s all if, maybe, perhaps, probably
@CyborgCode it’s a standard github feature. They have templates you can use
@jesster_king I’m short on twitter
@CyborgCode make a repo named username dot github dot com (or dot io) and put an index.html in it
@jcran never let @quine … ? I can think of so many ways to end this statement
@comex that’s on the Feds - and the lady who effectively killed Aaron Swartz, apparently.
@inversephase in this case they suddenly showed up like half an hour later.
My long-form explanation of why we, the greater Boston area, did what we did. http://t.co/sP0FRN9rhZ

@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige I know it doesn't fit the narrative but cops aren't all 100% total screwups 100% of the time.
@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige and the article ends with the person *emphasizing* he thought they did a good job.
@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige I don't see anywhere in here it says they broke into his house without consent
@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige can you read? he was outside and there were gunshots, of course someone yelled "get down"
@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige stop projecting your narrative. They knocked.
@deathtolamo @profoundlypaige he consented...
@JohnnyCocaine @thegrugq that was the ONE smart thing about this - zillions of tourists lining the streets on this one particular day
@JohnnyCocaine @thegrugq it closed briefly; there were far, far too many tourists who needed to go home to keep it on lockdown long
@thegrugq all of this was stupid from top to bottom - they didn’t even leave the city in the huge time window they had
@profoundlypaige it wasn’t too bad unless you were in Watertown proper - my manager’s house was barricaded to keep him from becoming hostage
@profoundlypaige yes I live a few miles north of Boston and I was in the city proper during the manhunt
@profoundlypaige a mix of having been on the radio, following a lot of other locals on twitter, and major press summaries after the fact
@profoundlypaige so they probably have friends but all evidence points to them being the ones on the scene
@profoundlypaige at least three other people have been taken in for questioning so far
@focalintent apparently it was just the driver’s own cellphone. They kidnapped him then kicked him out.
@profoundlypaige from our POV in Boston there was suddenly a shooting and we had no idea it was the bombers for a good while
@profoundlypaige that kind of all went out the window the instant they started shooting, that’s not “innocent” in any circumstance
@profoundlypaige oh and they told the driver they kidnapped that they were.
@profoundlypaige technically no, but they match the photos, started shooting cops, and risked bleeding to death rather than surrender
@michealc no, see immediately previous RT - marathon bombers stole car with cell phone inside. We all know the outcome :)
I’m glad violent criminals are notoriously stupid and don’t think to check for cell phones in cars they just jacked
@MarkKriegsman google is commanding me to do the wishing
@sakjur lol nope. Found it though. It was... tucked behind my husband's gaming computer downstairs
Somewhere in this pile of books and assorted sundry is my missing MacBook Air. I think. #geekproblems
@iain_mk2 @DrPizza @gudkopy okay I’ve been ignoring this but as if this didn’t start with a cherry picked single person’s incident
@amazingant yeah that’s the thing - I need at least one gap in the perimeter for my experiments, sometimes a big one
@MrToph sir why are you sending me panty shots
@amazingant it turns out it’s quite hard to block a signal broadcasted from a giant tower one and a half blocks away
@amazingant it’s sitting in the corner waiting for me to work on it some more, but preliminary evidence is that it will never be very good
@MrToph cyan underpants huh
@Dr_Review … why am I reading too much into a rated-E video game plot?
@Dr_Review seeing as the Rockets have access to the exact same resources and are much older and in greater number,…
@LBontempoNunes baseball bats would probably be more effective than zubats
Pokemon: a major corporation is under siege from a terrorist organization and the only person who bothers to show up to stop them is a 10yo
@iain_mk2 @gudkopy @DrPizza and this is worse than the American situation how…?
@kaepora http://t.co/jaK3pnfDI4
@markrendle it’s almost as if we’re two variations of the same basic culture ;) C&amp;C @DrPizza
@jack_daniel stuttered and stalled
@gudkopy @DrPizza the British are obnoxious and pretentious, but I think they’re onto something with the “not letting people suffer” thing
For the record I don’t advocate for any subculture of feminism which denies transgenderism, that’s just recycling the prejudice
@bugbrennan excuse me ma’am but are you aware of the idea that if you don’t want to have sex with someone, simply refrain from doing so
@pzmyers @bugbrennan um parson me you do know being a lesbian does not mean you must have sex with every woman you meet right
@pzmyers @bugbrennan …… what?
Now to sit back and play Pokemon Blue like the gods intended. Sorry, BeaCon…
@leighhollowell fffffff-!!!
@pokemon_ebooks but… but… eggs!
@WhiteMageSlave ohhhhh riiiiiiight THOSE GUYS  Hahaha losers
@DarthNull thatsthejoke.jpg ;)
Terrorism all over the place, exploding factories, massive earthquakes, the only thing left is a Black Plague outbreak
@panther_modern @kaepora the part where they’re “thought to” have “unprobed” links to “hellbent” clerics
Fox News is thought to have as-yet unprobed ties to a radical editor hellbent on destroying journalism
Check out how carefully Fox words things so they can make accusations w/o evidence http://t.co/M4risIG78J ht @kaepora
@ternus decided to stay home this time, in case the entire city catches fire and floods with molasses
@mikko @mrHithron huh, this got lost in a mention flood earlier… … no, except some people think that’s what a DDoS is, but they’re wrong.
@mdowd that doesn’t look nearly lethal enough to be Australian
@ameaijou you’re a cat
@Hyder_Khan @Omgitstamz the average Bostonian is quite the opposite of a redneck, but there’s no denying there’s some racists in the bunch
I’m suddenly really sad that the time I larped as a zombie was before poor college students carried smartphones
@rantyben well, everything in context
@ternus do you play an elf? I bet you play an elf
@ternus never underestimate my willingness to troll people I like, or to beat them with foam and duct tape weapons
@hackedy only if it has a soft foam tip
@donicer @GreatDismal duh @jack_daniel
4) subtweet and see if they defend themselves ;)
1) meet someone cute 2) scope out their github 3) there’s totally a larp app in here
It’s suddenly pouring rain. Considerate of it to hold off this long really
@0x17h people did, nothing happened
@ggreenwald @marshray just because the govt will let him get away with it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t deride it as barbaric
@Dictum anyway there’s a nearly 100% correlation with strangers calling me “Melissa” instead of my twitter handle being obnoxious, so bye
@Dictum anyway there’s a nearly 100% correlation with strangers calling me “Melissa” instead of my twitter handle being obnoxious, so bye
@Dictum or burning down cabins or any of this other wretched nonsense. Next step: make sure suspect’s rights are respected
@Dictum I’m a fan of the fact that we can apprehend terror suspects without shooting up old ladies delivering newspapers
@ioerror the only people I can find “cheering” that are professional politicians.
@Dictum there are so SO many recent examples of cops totally screwing up but we have a massive operation where they, like, apparently didn’t
@Dictum there are people on twitter who posted they said no and nothing happened as is the law amazing I know sometimes it works
@Dictum martial law is when you get shot at, or at best arrested, for the crime of leaving your house
@Dictum see my previous tweet - house searches were by consent - “seek shelter” was not some kind of ultimatum
Today was a day of very heavy police presence and you have every right to not be cool with that but it fell way short of actual martial law
@thegrugq it won’t “keep up.” We’ve been in the “War on Terror” for twelve years and it hardly shows up to a single battle
@deathtolamo I haven’t heard of such an incident, but if it can be evidenced then that’s at least one case of the police acting wrongly
@marcusjcarey I saw someone on twitter who says she said no and that was that
Please keep in mind that no homes were searched without consent and no one was arrested for going outside, this actually *isn’t* martial law
.@GrahamBlog would you kindly sod off? WHAT war? Is there a civil war on I didn’t know about?
People worried about the financial cost to Boston: Boston wants to know if “Zero Tolerance For Terrorism, Inc” prefers cash or debit
@thegrugq who’s tried to hijack an airplane around here recently? Terrorists have *always* known about Very Obvious Targets
@thegrugq and IMO taking this Extremely Personally(tm) is a deterrent to anyone who isn’t planning on being suicidal in the process
@thegrugq that’s true of pretty much any violent crime. If I throw a brick through a window, police will respond
@dani0xE tweetbot
@thegrugq we spend more on storm cleanup a dozen times a winter.
@thegrugq I can assure you Boston considers it worth every penny as we took it personally
@ternus where’s my licensing fee
Crashed for four hours. 700 new tweets. Oh… dear.
@0x6D6172696F is it the bug you and I share where it’s too easy to cast our names to int?
Our government is filled with festering peat bogs like @GrahamBlog who want to get rid of pesky human rights
@GrahamBlog how dare you claim to uphold our Constitution
@GrahamBlog enemy combatant working for which army exactly?
@miuaf I don’t know much about military hardware but they’re the kind that are small as tanks go
The tanks are a show of force… you’re not gonna shoot at one skinny dude with a tank in a residential area
@DrPizza no except in a part of Watertown I think. That’s where the tanks are, as if you can use a tank to target one person lol
@DrPizza the trains are down and we are *asked* to stay inside.
We even crossed through part of Watertown and it was alive and well. The crazy stuff is in a fairly small area
Let me repeat because I’m still seeing it: the entire city of #boston is NOT shut down. People in parks people on corners cars on roads
I hope I am never so glad to have made it home again. If I see this guy I’m kicking him down seventeen flights of stairs
How to tell the Boston police are busy: parked in two hour parking &gt; 24 hours. No ticket.
This end of town is pretty much out and about, the reports that the whole city is "cowering" are false mmkay
Taxi obtained and persuaded
There are a lot of people just now accepting that white Muslims are totally a thing. Now accept most of them are more like the uncle
Why do we even have a street named Laurel? No one in Boston can pronounce that
@kaepora @spacerog many as he is accused of carjacking
@ternus sir are you implying my antenna is not proper
@spacerog it finally did on like the sixth try
Fine, I will see if I can get it on my actual radio, but last night it was too fuzzy
@nemof no luck
Ustream killed.
I may have heard wrong but it sounds like they said the suspect wants to talk to them on cell phone
One thing I’ve learned: accidentally leaving mics open is a major problem for cops
Cancel search for green Honda: they have it
@Jolly I’d like to think Boston is better than that…  … especially since the suspect is literally more Caucasian than me
1999 Honda civic, green, POSSIBLY the suspect #boston
@Ammoniak @savagejen yeah I think it’s overloaded
(I’m super ultra for citizen journalism, but don’t try to pass yourself off as ‘the press’)
@kaepora it’s okay, he’s clearly whiter than… hrm…
@zeightyfiv @m1sp it’d be disproportionate if it was a generic police shooting, but these are bombing suspects, not gangsters
#radiotweeting Don’t walk into a manhunt and say “I’m with the press” if you don’t have any sort of press credentials handy
@ternus where are you going anyway
Well-meaning housekeeping asked if I “know what time that will be” when I said we’re staying till transport is open
Okay I give up if @j_tsar is the right guy or not, way too many conflicting reports of “confirmed true/false” :p
@therulerofchina I’m alive
@perel42 hoping to stave off being blacklisted as a tracking server as long as possible I imagine

@JZdziarski @i0n1c @thegrugq girls are anti-conference she-devils, of course!
@i0n1c @thegrugq I’m sorry you must confront your worst fear
@stevegibson @metropolitanrep it shows 5 am for me. Since it’s right under “Boston” I figured it was eastern time but not necessarily.
@stevegibson @metropolitanrep time stamp on last logged in
@HiveLibrary @puellavulnerata and the city is not / was not on total lockdown. Woke up, looked outside, people.
@HiveLibrary @puellavulnerata just chilling inside because someone nearby is violent with nothing to lose is not stupid or cowardly
@ternus the news says taxis are allowed out again so general traffic movement except for Watertown should be soon
@ternus we cleared it with the hotel that we can chill until the all clear is given, which I assume will happen within a few hours
@evejou @marcusjcarey well that’s kind of the correct response when your nephews shoot up completely innocent people
@ternus we’re still camped out at the hotel, as we were effectively trapped when this started to go down
Their uncle is vehemently not supporting them. None of this “I can’t believe my boys would do this” he’s demanding they take responsibility
I think I just literally heard the suspects’ uncle say they did it because they’re losers.
The hotel kindly agreed to let us blow off the checkout time, and they’re keeping their continental breakfast open indefinitely
@cirdan12 regardless of how one feels about guns, the gun one actually wasn’t total theatre for once
FYI there are both pedestrians and cars around here, it’s not like the city is in total shutdown
Apparently I’m on lockdown.
Awake. Sirens everywhere, unsurprisingly. What is the sitch
@SimonZerafa good morning from a high rise in Boston
I’m not kidding. My manager lives in Watertown. He texted DH that the police blocked the doors to his house.
@jlwfnord @fredowsley with luck we might actually get there by 404 tomorrow. Camping out in the hotel.
The police have barricaded my manager’s house shut to prevent the terrorists from taking him hostage.
In any case the adrenaline rush has crashed hard and I am once again too exhausted to process this. May the morning dawn in peace
So let me fill you in on a secret. The initial guessing based on developing details? That’s actually what the news *is*.
Male coworkers I’ve shared a hotel room with: four (okay, three, if my husband doesn’t count)
@jlwfnord (it’s not the frilly lace up kind)
@jlwfnord back support.
Step 1. Get this corset off Step 2. Don’t cut the sleeping pill in half Step 3. ???
@0x17h some of us live here you know.
Our room number is 911. On the plus side the clerk told us not to worry about checkout time.
I admire that pizza delivery car. #boston
Looks like we’re getting terrorist-proof hotel rooms on corporate dime
@_larry0 in the lobby, but I hear hotels frown on that sort of thing
@vathpela not quite. I can see several intersections but none anywhere near the crisis
I am considerably more awake now… if you’re wondering I am still at the Source hotel, up several floors, quite safe here.
Personal acquaintances are telling me they heard small explosions so I consider this verified #boston
@_larry0 so I’m huddled on the floor in the CTF room exhausted to the point of tears
@_yossi_ who freaking knows it could be any ol’ crazy pants whackjob who wants to commit suicide by cop
@_larry0 yeah except he decided at the last minute we’re not and he’d just take us home whenever
Oh my gods I can’t even process this   Another stupid little bomb  Is this real? Not just crazy speculation getting out of hand? Tell me
I am too exhausted to listen to the radio and process what’s going on. Sorry.
@maxtch I mostly use OSX which transparently replaces gcc with llvm
@skyeyemachine this is not the face of poverty this is the face of not bothering to get a room
Techno hobo camp, by request http://t.co/aXicQUDIJ7
@Jedi_Amara glad you noticed
@maxtch yes, sometimes and not really.
Doing the techno hobo thing, sleeping on a pile of con t-shirts, hugging my bag of computers, in the corner of the CTF room
@DrPizza windowing… apps… I feel you could base an interface on that… but what to call it
Watching the city sidewalk from the fifth floor, some guy is just pacing and kicking poles. Oh now he's dancing #exciting
@blowdart you and I are on a different plane of concern, the big picture, the corner cases, legal stuff
@blowdart but I feel quite sure that one day soon, logging-into-their-Facebook pranks will be as uncouth as sneaking into their house
@blowdart it’s in a state of flux. Technology is changing faster than culture. Kids are making new etiquette faster than parents can teach
@ternus oh yes :3
So I just noticed Defcon’s CFP is still open for a good while and I must be crazy because… …
@codeferret_ then I have no idea why you need my twitter
DH is trying to steal my phone to post questions to twitter so he can “obtain the answer via hacking”
Source Boston CTF - @quine presides over his domain http://t.co/OHgvIHnEu4

@demize95 find me when I have my backpack with me :p
Guess whose laptop @codeferret_ had to borrow for the ctf http://t.co/pFegagfhC8
@binnightbot hi! I try. It breaks a lot of JavaScript interfaces :)
@WeldPond if they were HTML filtering server side *anyway*…
@savagejen what  What
@hermanos @vogon because we all know 4chan is racist and it’s embarrassing
@triple5adam well, I’d hope they’re mutual, but one is Old(tm) and they both did the girlfriend namedrop :p
I love how our three letter agencies are so drone-happy but flip out when a civilian helicopter does a flyby
My key Source Boston takeaway: two new infosec crushes
@ternus pro
@McGrewSecurity @mikko @spacerog @dotMudge @WeldPond @dildog @joegrand I can confirm this works
@s_bridges @BernardGaynor @0x17h eww, he has more than two children? What a sham marriage. Everyone knows that.
Remember when sites and services not targeted at children had swear filtering? Oh nineties internet
@VoluntaryMan aliens are not currently in my threat model
@ReinH is that a mod? I've always played vanilla (haven't started a new fort in a while actually)
@cybergibbons I think at this point it would be perceived as increasing police secrecy which wouldn't go over well (I hope)
@jonelf of course I'm simply receiving it better, that's how radio works :p
You know what's cool? Knowing there's going to be police coming down the street before you hear the sirens is cool
@cybergibbons @zeroday yes \o/
@mikk0j it's free software called SDR# (sharp)
@thoward37 @zeroday Don't give me a transmitter whatever you do.
Especially cool/funny is that one of them was like "I can't hear you it's breaking up" but I could hear both sides // @zeroday
I think I found a walkie-talkie, someone is asking their buddy where the blueprints to some air conditioning thing are // @zeroday
@blowdart uh, yeah, that's kind of the point. You let your friends into your house too.
@blowdart walk up to a teenage girl and ask to see her SMS to her best friend and her boyfriend. Observe.
@blowdart it's very much their concern. Don't confuse being totally open about some things as totally open on everything
Now we're waiting for that moment when culture changes and invading digital privacy is seen as utterly unacceptable whether it's easy or not
History of security: we gave up on perfect locks over a hundred years ago. The lock-and-key is now primarily symbolic.
@zeroday @ra6bit anywhere in the 500mhz range
@0x17h this hotel has a wireless mic in each meeting room that shows up somewhere in the 500mhz range
History of security: the British thought they had an unpickable lock for 40 years until they handed one to an American. Isolation is bad
@0x17h http://t.co/w48I67n9Qa
History of Physical Security: arguably the first "open source" was publicly funded and released lock research in the 1700s
@isa56k @torvos oh I'm sure it is - it's just not something people really think about
@isa56k @torvos oh I'm sure it is - it's just not something people really think about
@JZdziarski I don't really consider "it needs to be jailbroken and you need to know the root password" to be a general iOS vuln...
@judsontwit this only related to on-device stuff, not backups
I like how someone just referred to USB sideloading as "shoving the app in sideways"
@RSWestmoreland @Kufat I think I am listening to some people setting up a stage for a special event, struggling with bulky props
.@torvos ah, sorry - context is iOS
iOS: your contacts stay unencrypted when you lock the device: required for incoming call info
MDM server messages aren't signed? For serious?
@Kufat I can just get up and walk
I have no idea whose microphone I am tapping but it sounds like there's something awkwardly BDSM-like going on in a room near here
@RussMichaels @ternus yes, yes, use gender-based comparisons, implying female organs are associated with inferiority, that'll change my mind
"I think I follow this stuffed animal on twitter" http://t.co/VptMi4PeRR
@niteshad @savagejen @dan_crowley it's just leaky
@ternus they kicked me out of the room because I'm not invited so now I'm charging my doom radio at the badge desk ;(
@ternus you coming to the conf now? Going to the Akamai private lunch? ;(
@savagejen @dan_crowley http://t.co/LkS9KRN5Q3
@savagejen @dan_crowley it's passive, my radio can't broadcast
@savagejen @dan_crowley I'm in your microphone intercepting your signal
@savagejen @dan_crowley boop da ba doop http://t.co/qjkTAz6uo6
@ra6bit I found the FM output of the mic in here about halfway between the two frequencies listed on the LCD :)
Never mind, @dan_crowley is wearing a clip-on mic set very very quiet, and I found it :D
I came prepared to intercept @dan_crowley's microphone and he's going bare-voiced

@sakjur it's because the president is here for the memorial
Boston is chock full of guards with assault rifles - not a good day for the gun-phobic
@KirilsSolovjovs fan fiction writers
Oh! I get it. Congress is a social experiment to measure cognitive dissonance
@akopa we have Pennsylvania for that
@rbf_ no, I’m not advocating that the president is temporary king.  I’m saying our congress does the absolute worst job possible.
@rbf_ hahahahahahaha once upon a dream
At this point I wonder why we even have a congress, stupid question I know
@JastrzebskiJ if fifty shades had stayed on the fanfic boards where it was birthed there wouldn’t have been a problem :p
Someone writing fanfic means they liked your story SO MUCH it took over their creative output; it’s probably terrible writing but that’s ok
How to kill all my desire to read your stuff: finding out you’re a jerk to fanficcers. Looking at you Anne Rice
@amanicdroid what I’m saying is: “my dad died in an accident” vs “my dad was murdered”: completely different psychologically
But the human heart accepts accidents. Malice, we know, is always deliberate, we measure it accordingly
How strange that accidents can so readily kill and maim far more people than the most bitter acts of malice
@TheDaveCA \&gt;_&lt;/ reasonable policies are hard, let’s go shopping

@jb33z yes, and I bought a nylon costume of it, a gray sailor fuku with strawberry pink trim

@ra6bit @_larry0 @csoandy bingo
Someone told me I should wear my Kasane Teto dress to this con but I think it'd be wasted on most of this crowd
@Brian_Sniffen @erluko everyone at the table already expressed regrets he's not here
@chriseng he saw me doing my happy dance at beansec and thinks it means I can't be a real infoseccer...
Someone at this table is wearing a Casio calculator watch and the person next to him is wearing a pebble
Having dinner with half of Akamai apparently. And @joshcorman. Who still isn't over the dancing thing
@eevee your cat is very lucky to have a human able to seek advanced medical care - good luck
@Saturn500Jared the joke is I’m being literal - he’s coming.

@whyallthenoise that's what I'm working on; finding weird noise :)
@focalintent the FM music station range is completely saturated on my display here - a red and yellow blotch
@focalintent both I suppose but I was thinking of radio

@jb33z which does happen - they got slapped down over GPSs without warrants
@jb33z unfortunately where the FBI etc. is concerned they just assume everything's legal until a judge flips out on them
Is hacking back legal?: the answer is "try it and find out," basically.
@Computermaster ... I actually don't remember. I somehow hit upon it as a magic hex value, and was apparently delighted with it

@VoluntaryMan I ride the official clients' case hard because I am disappointed in them but I still love them #toughlove
"Hacking Back is a Bad Idea" by @ITSecurity I assume this is named after me
@ra6bit exactly the sort of thing I wanted to find - I got am sdr specifically to see what I can spy on that people forget about
@ra6bit I recorded it as FM and it is clearly audible
@ra6bit the range looks like this - so much stuff http://t.co/qBJWIevq8K
@ra6bit you repeat yourself!
@ra6bit incidentally that range is crammed full here but I don't see anything resembling his voice pattern
@ra6bit if I can pick it up and identify it, it counts.

.@ternus: Attack your org from the outside to get better buyin for fixing the problems you find
.@ternus: think and ACT like the adversary. Be evil to yourself
.@ternus talk: culture of resilience. Ingrain it in the developers that they must overengineer.
.@ternus talk: Akamai has an absolutely staggering attack surface and if they go down, the internet is effectively down. No pressure.

Great, we've reached the stage where idiots call in threats to random public places. There's always someone
@chriseng so I think DH is refusing to pick me up tonight...
@bobpoekert well if you're on the outside of twitter you will hit api limits if you do anything more than proof of concept anyway.
(Note that the thing about computing relationship graphs being too expensive is from the far side of the twitter API - easier on the inside)
A year or two ago there was someone who tried to do avatar analysis on twitter accounts and gave up because of Justin Bieber :p
Twitter talk: finding bots via relationship graphs is too expensive, especially if you don't already know for sure one is a bot
Twitter talk: machine learning is ~80% effective on simple measurements like how many accounts a potential bot tweets to
Twitter talk: Omniture, owned by Adobe, registered http://t.co/MxS9P295th (that's a letter) to fill your logs with ie 192.168.1.2O7 .net
Twitter talk: half of all bots last under forty five minutes. Most go silent of their own accord very quickly
.@secmoose I'd prefer if someone I don't like locks out their account :)
Twitter talk: there are account brute force tools. Implying twitter doesn't implement password lockout? Anyone know?
Twitter talk: the history of spam on twitter is giant spikes being fought back down, baseline steadily rising, for the first few years
Don't answer that
is EVERYONE who works for Kaspersky very attractive or only people they send to do talks? Or do I just have a thing for foreign geeks
IMO asking people not to obsessively speculate over photos of intense interest is asking a waterfall to hold on for a sec

@nelhage but that’s already what PHP is  Good glory
@nelhage holy guacamole you found my next manual masterpiece why does this exist
.@jcran showing pics of retail stores filled with tablet displays - and you know they’re not properly locked down
@AsherLangton @flipzagging 4chan is a racist site. No denying that. But I don’t think they look particularly “brown” anyway
@flipzagging @blaufish_ it’s plausible. You don’t want all cops at a major event to be blatantly cops.
@flipzagging it’s all “maybe.” At this point posting their real names, if 4chan found that somehow, would be irresponsible
Having a backpack isn’t suspicious. Taking it off isn’t suspicious. But when a bomb in a backpack has ALREADY triggered, you check for that.
@flipzagging it wouldn’t be suspicious if a bomb in a backpack hadn’t already gone off. We’re post-suspicion. *Someone* left a bomb in a bag
@blaufish_ @blowdart really it comes down to: they appear to be carrying the right kind of backpack and appear to put it down
@blowdart @blaufish_ they don’t even look “brown” to me. From the photos I thought they were white.
@blaufish_ you can just buy clothes like that here, and order a custom badge or nick one.
.@blaufish_ they could be cops who happened to be right there and soon identified as such. Or looking like cops to avert suspicion.
@hackerfantastic (and our law enforcement specifically asked for crowd sourced photos and videos, so they’re looking at the same data)
@hackerfantastic doodling on public photos is not interfering with an investigation
@EternalTodo yes, but that one was called out as specifically what malware checks for, presumably it’s the most popular
@grp I don’t think anyone ever questioned if he did what the court said he did - only a question of how wrong it was. Public said “not very”
@grp their standards are higher than casual internet discourse, at least…
No, of course the photos aren’t “proof.” Nothing is proof before it even goes to court. Don’t attack people in black jackets :p
@blowdart wrong about what? There’s no personally identifying information. Just circles on photographs
“Greater or equal than” is probably not how to grammar, I admit, but that is how I pronounce the &gt;= operator
@amanicdroid well yes, but I’d expect that most defenders of any language would work primarily in that language
I found everyone on twitter who would advocate for ColdFusion as greater or equal than PHP as a platform. There are two of them
Nothing is as powerful as an angry internet http://t.co/RTavnuTtHc
@meta_alex you’ve probably written more cold fusion than me - I’ve probably audited more code bases for 0day than you :)
@blaufish_ @chriseng both! SE has a nearly 100% success rate and google archiving is forever.
@thegrugq like was discussed in the talk - for a typical business your primary concern is monetary fraud, not stolen intel
.@ra6bit and @dildog just observed neither of them have ever seen me use a physical keyboard. #touchscreenmania
@blaufish_ @chriseng you can unintentionally leak directly to a real outside attacker, that’s often how they do it.
@thegrugq the threat model for Joe’s Business is a little different though.
@m1sp dude you are objectively adorable
I appreciate that @NintendoAmerica memed their own announcement. Hey, at least you’re not making Half-Life…

@jenniferbn2 source Boston - the American Boston :)
@jenniferbn2 I’m at a talk ^_^
Insider threat: tracking geolocation and login time is too noisy in most orgs. Accessing unusual hosts happens. Only worry if ALL are weird
Insider threat: did you know removing an account from Active Directory doesn’t kill open sessions? Oops.
Insider threat: leading indication of fraud is multiple valid employee accounts logging in from the same single-person computer
Insider threat: usually fraud for personal profit, followed by spiteful damage of systems, “spy stuff” is a distant third
Insider threat: The more data you log, however, the more likely you’re going to cause privacy problems. Who has access, what are the limits
Insider threat: though of course log retention is critical
Insider threat: use “soft” investigative methods first. Don’t just start going through computer logs. Keep legal dept involved.
I agree that basic user education is a must even if it can never be 100% effective. Enable people to know what’s always a mistake
@chriseng thinking in general overall terms - there aren’t very many professional moles in the world
Negligent insiders are the most common threat - completely unintentional data leaks far more likely than being betrayed…
@stevelord time to first worlder seeking asylum

@thegrugq @i0n1c you’ve always got me, but I think he blocked me
@rantyben @comex @i0n1c I may not be involved with either but there’s a key difference: I’d kiss comex

@leethax0r that’s a discovery of the hackers, not the vuln, afaik

@chadwik66 dare I even ask
Good glory some @arstechnica readers need to figure out not all headlines are 100% literal
@fncombo in what?
@bradplumer @focalintent Africa is a great what
@trevortimm @RepMikeRogers @mattblaze contrary to rumor I am not, in fact, fourteen. The basement part is debatable
@Kufat I’m more of a kicker
said abadidea immediately before receiving a letter that she is banned from Apple campus
So I think I volunteered to beat up an Apple engineer and steal the iOS signing key today
@tapbot_paul was that headline cutoff generated or curated? ;)
@grsecurity what's the point of going back to an older tweet and telling me to get over it? I've been over it
@chriseng think I left my book in your room
@bsdaemon @grsecurity ... But since he doesn't follow anyone it appears to be the project's twitter and I got nothin' against the project.
@bsdaemon @grsecurity he already replied, we've already had our spat ...
@dinodaizovi ... But he was at the wrong Marriott anyway.
@dinodaizovi thank you very much, I'm sorry I had to run off so suddenly
Spot the typo ... at least I hope it's a typo http://t.co/1dZ5UuERYG
@dinodaizovi you seem nice will you be my dinner buddy
Let the record show I am sitting in front of Dear Teammate Brandon’s unlocked Linux machine and NOT breaking anything
#srcbos13 so who is my dinner date
@Beryllium9 contains vulns
An oddly enough, java and .net web apps are much more likely to contain directory traversal than php
Veracode brings the data: ColdFusion leads the pack for XSS and SQLi per capita. PHP is the den of OS command injection
@WeldPond don't call large groups of programmers "guys". I'm calling you out in front of the room next time ;)
Next: bothering Boss http://t.co/EiVecqNfXX
@comex I think @dinodaizovi is officially my rival now he's crazy about you
Best line I've heard all day: "and then this OTHER virtual machine in the font renderer..."
@kherge meh I guess
@0xcharlie @dinodaizovi @comex no

Next up: I sit in the front row and demand @dinodaizovi smile for the camera http://t.co/6kLl4BNeSF

Sirens. More sirens. Too many freaking sirens.
Also you really shouldn’t be using FTP for uploading in the first place. Use WinSCP or even bare SCP if you’re cool. Change hosts if needed
Next up: @quine the incredible talking koala on Android appsec  (He was blocking me on twitter before @i0n1c made it cool)
@marginoferror yes it's just careless and easily targeted
@brentrubell unencrypted
@xa329 it is, that doesn't matter
@thegrugq but their announcements are so cute
@brentrubell no, CuteFTP isn't malware - it's targeted by malware because it's too easy to recover the stored password
I get such a kick out of how "professional" the Blackhole people are. Malice as a service !
Don't use CuteFTP - malware scrapes hard drives for your unencrypted credentials to your personal website to host Blackhole #srcbos13
@comex speaking of conference you should be at Source Boston! :o

#boston My Verizon cell phone lost data…
@JastrzebskiJ man why you gotta harsh my blogging mellow
@burukuru not directly; all the injured got help and the runners and tourists back to their hotels
@DarthNull 7th floor, street side, I probably have an ear for this
@burukuru well I was thinking a little more specifically as that was yesterday...
@DarthNull going on an hour and a half nonstop.
@NinRac but that wouldn’t be internally consistent with my behavior :)
@waruikoohii also an apartment in your town was searched with consent apparently…
#boston okay I’ve heard sirens nonstop for an hour from the Marriott Tremont. Hashtag is flooded with well-wishes, can’t find why…
@wimremes meh, turns out subtweeting them is easier
@locks I don’t, but I like zenburn and desert
@waruikoohii unmarked buses, couldn’t see if they’re occupied, I assume they’re the buses used to rescue from the lockdown zone yesterday

@CastIrony last year before Blackhat/Defcon I actually wrote the hashes of the certs of sites like twitter down on paper XD

They’ve already said on the news you can expect public transport to be swarmed with cops tomorrow.
Bostonians: I hate being submissive to the surveillance state but tomorrow would be a good day to double check your bag before you go out
@eevee but looking again, I realize that “they” is a smaller error space
@eevee that
#boston I keep hearing sirens - but of course there’s going to be some any night. #confirmationbias
@_wirepair in any case, we are in the city now, and everything is okay, but the hotel searched us
@_wirepair uh yeah where were you (oh right Japan) (carry on)
I can't imagine having hair that short like what keeps your head weighed down so it doesn't float away
That awkward moment when there's not enough shampoo in the hotel room oh wait I'm sharing it with someone with a shaved head shampoo party !
@aksansai I suspect it would trigger a specific unit conversion card she doesn't have
Accidentally bumped Siri. Well that's a new one (device is running iOS5 because reasons) http://t.co/faypWVsWA2
@blaufish_ that's pretty much all Christian groups to varying extents ;) their theological pedigree is not particularly pure
Abadidea's Source Boston "Don't You Tweet This" Count: 2 and the conference doesn't start for 12 hours
@bond_alexander I turned 25 two weeks ago so you're good at this
@watAtwist yup but I went with WBC because they're literally praising their god for the bombings
@WhiteMageSlave they were talking about pushing middle age and the guy says to me "but what are you, 19?" "she's 17"
@bond_alexander how old do you think I am? :D
Boss just told someone I was 17 and they didn't question it.
@blaufish_ llet me know if he says Nazis don't count as Christian so I can double block him :)
@blaufish_ lol I blocked him like two hours ago
@ra6bit I took a class on terrorism in college ;) #TweetsThatGetMeOnLists
Hearing twitter say the type of bomb, detonated on the ground, is designed to take out everyone's legs and incapacitate them - which it did
@panther_modern the reports are accurate - I was listening to the radio - one was triggered deliberately and two recovered for evidence
@ra6bit guess it comes to "did the malicious actor actually know what they were doing"
Me watching TV: "I know this is America but why is *everyone* fat? Oh... 4:3 stretched to widescreen"
@lil_lost it correlated very closely with the most crowded finishing time last year
Am I crazy if I speculate someone specifically designed those bombs to hurt but not to kill people? Or is our luck just good with 130 to 3
The hotel bar is packed, probably because most places closed early. #Boston
Here I am doing Source Boston setup late at night again. In some ways it feels like it's been years. In others, a week.
@WhiteMageSlave we're fine, I promise! Emergency response has done an A+ job
. @SOURCEConf Boston: they will ask your name / look in your bag at the hotel because of today's events.
@kaepora yeah - at Source
@kragen I live here! :)
We're being searched at the hotel but they're being polite about it
I have the most exquisite knack for unintentional implications in my tweets, mainly concerning my quest for pants
@SabrinaPennello #thats  #the  #point
@Steve31278 it’s not a scorecard  But if you want it to be, look up civilian and “unknown” casualties in our warzones…
@Steve31278 ha, also not true. But I’m not a Christian, so I’m not particularly fond of them.
@Steve31278 and probably forgetting all the American terror incidents perpetrated by white or Asian guys with guns.
@Steve31278 again, you’re extrapolating based on a BILLION people,
Btw I am apparently going to Source Boston tonight, as soon as I find my pants. Will crash with boss, unless I get a better offer :p
@Steve31278 the west
@Steve31278 overgeneralizing large groups by the worst actions of any member is how we got into this mess
@Steve31278 I wish I lived in a world where that was true! But women are punished for being victims here, and there are feminists there.
@Steve31278 “Muslim” is a vague category that covers well over a billion human beings. Of course there are some bad people in there.
@Steve31278 right, because noone who describes themself as a Christian has ever hurt anyone for hateful reasons!
@LJonhny #thatsthepoint
Oh, Westboro doesn’t represent your religion? Well of course they don’t, that’s the point
If you’re going to cite one Muslim as proof that Muslims are happy when we’re bombed, remember Westboro Baptist Church is a Christian group.
.@Robbie some people were still on the one I was listening to; it gently tapered off to really minor stuff.
Emergency radio has gone very quiet. Hopefully that’s that!
@pmocek @ioerror check the time stamps. That was the controlled detonation of the third device. https://t.co/iAzahOnqHU
@PatDollard police say this is a fake story.
@thegrugq re: the bridge it was apparently a footbridge, which makes more sense
@IanAKemp "yeah I'm standing by a blue... a blue... um... !$%&amp;"
@IanAKemp I heard it once - ironically, simply because he couldn't remember the word for the type of thing he was standing near XD
Impressed with the good job responders have done helping everyone get back to their hotels or find the people coming to pick them up
@landley the professional radio stations don’t have so much static though - this emergency radio is a mess !
@paisleyboxers looks like he’s harping on the fact he’s not technically employed by anyone as a columnist
Is @erikrush really a non-parody account? What a wretchedly hateful person.
@CyborgCode but in general, being good at context switching
@CyborgCode well today is a little higher volume than usual because I’m in Boston!
@savagejen emergency response is on the ball. After the initial explosion, everything has been about protecting and helping civilians.
I don’t unconditionally agree with anyone I defend. I don’t even unconditionally agree with myself
@grsecurity good thing I don’t know very many people like that!
@thegrugq @grsecurity you never let me get in any fights by myself :(
@grsecurity okay, sure. I think you’re a jerk. I think you’re rude, arrogant, and trust to technical accomplishments to cover for you.
@grsecurity wasn’t involved in? It was on reddit, that’s not really how that works :p
@michaeldinn radio
Okay, now one of the packages they’re investigating is smoking for an unknown reason. #exciting
@thoward37 not really a camping out in the public infrastructure kind of place - it was sleeting here like two days ago
@Hyder_Khan because I’ve spent the last three hours trying to understand people on the emergency radio and some have poor radio voices
@chronic I’m not Canadian or French but that just looks weird
Now they’re going to investigate a backpack stashed under a bridge - I think they said Waltham? Probably a false positive
All in favor of banning people with deep voices from operating radios say "aye" in a clear, high-pitched voice ;)
@grsecurity Actually I was of the opinion you were reading too much into it - upset over points I simply can't find in the text.
@grsecurity (and I didn't feel like drawing out your trademark condescending remarks, that's why I subtweeted. Oh, look!)
@grsecurity you know reddit doesn't send a new orangered when someone edits a reply, right? That's not exactly a reading comprehension thing
@hemantmehta @WBCSays if it turns out there is a hell, it’s just barely large enough to hold their building.

@fredowsley everyone from work and our infosec friends are accounted for. Don’t use the cell network, use iMessage etc.
@fredowsley everyone from work and our infosec friends are accounted for. Don’t use the cell network, use iMessage etc.
@ralpost @Codepope the context was spender of grsec, but it applies pretty generally :p
There are a lot of conflicting reports about the cell network outage being deliberate and just being overwhelmed. #boston
@akopa I enjoy /r/netsec as mostly being a good news source/discussion center. Get in some good scraps though ;)
@xa329 … “spender” is someone’s name in this case ;)
Like is there some rule that you can’t be a major open source contributor without being incredibly hostile to anyone who has different goals
Back to infosec drama: spender will quietly move goalposts if you call him out on being a jerk. And signs his reddit posts for some reason
@ra6bit I suspect it’s that nothing you’d consider a “burner phone” works on LTE so they didn’t bother.
Based on people saying they DO have service, they apparently think no one would buy an LTE phone for their bomb ;)
@rgov @1DScoop they’re clearly excitable, but they are not the OP of the image, it went viral, can’t find the source for sure.
@rgov so I'm all for having a high level of taking-stuff-seriously until we know for sure we have a solid lead
@rgov usually there's a rash of false positive bombs after a bombing, but this one has had a rash of actual true positives;
@rgov there is of course every chance in the world it’s a photographer or spectator, but still interesting enough to check out.
@rgov it’d only be paranoia if nothing had happened and one was worried abstractly about someone on the roof being suspicious.
(The person on the roof could of course just be a photographer, that's a reasonable thing to do. But still a good lead...)
Sounds like they can't get the people coming from New York patched into their comms systems?
@dridus http://t.co/Y3NooCLtJV I could get out my SDR, but this is handling the load quite well

#boston #marathon looking for suspicious black male with black hoodie, black backpack, turned away by security 5 mins before explosion
@ataraxia_status @eevee they’re looking to ID the driver to determine if it was legitimate charity or a bomb smuggling attempt
@ataraxia_status @eevee they showed up at the delivery gate at the hospital and were turned away because they weren’t expected
They are looking for a yellow Penske truck that attempted to gain access to hospital and was turned away: may or may not be legit #boston
@eevee the prior is strongly supported by the first responder radio, at least.
@_larry0 @chriseng we’re a town and a half outside the city proper. I doubt it’d be practical to get in for many hours yet.
I just literally heard an officer say “pics plz” (of before and after I think, I’m not positive)
@chriseng (I assume everything will be all clear by tomorrow morning)
@chriseng I was thinking about hitching in a ride to the conference tonight but that doesn’t seem practical at the moment
@DarthNull so even if a route is open now it might not be in twenty minutes.
@DarthNull stay at the airport for a while. They’re still looking for more devices. Multiple ones have been found
@aaqian are you in the city w/o cell access? Just stay inside a private building. All the risk is in public places

@ra6bit that’s where I’m at - some of these people I simply can’t make out
One officer is flipping out about the signal problems - it’s strong enough but it’s not decoding properly
@gsuberland at this point it could be for any reason, as there’s no evidence or groups claiming responsibility
@waruikoohii all I made out was JFK
Sounds like they found *another* incendiary device (I'm having trouble understanding the feed, it's very fuzzy)
@Nial those processes are largely automated
Sobering reminder that this sort of thing occurs in some countries all the time.
@jack_daniel I’m still catching up to the very newest tweets, but I’ve seen surprisingly little of that
@jack_daniel well in the 40 minutes since you posted this, it’s unambiguously a bomb now :(
Sounds like there is about to be a controlled explosion of a discovered device #boston #marathon
@AmberBaldet volunteer here - I was outside the city proper - will be there tomorrow assuming this doesn't all go to hell :)
@SimonHoneydew We are a brave city, emergency services is on the ball and all victims have been rescued
All victims rescued. Witnesses being evacuated to Copley(?) Hotel #boston
@okoeroo the first one wasn't :(
Probably a bad time to make a joke about Boston police overreacting to things that look vaguely like bombs so uh keep your backpacks on
Whatever you do, do NOT drive through Boston or take the subway right now. The emergency radio is buzzing with more possible bombs
@chadwik66 I meant wait minutes

@BadAstronomer the real purpose of metric is just to make snow depth sound more dramatic, isn’t it!
@PwnieExpress is this in Boston? See you tomorrow :)
(I realize they were trying to fit all their hot issues into one tweet, but the result sounds just a wee touch over-violent)
@willjohansson @AsherLangton again, they were just trying to cram too much in one tweet and the result just sounds surreally violent.
@willjohansson @AsherLangton shooting someone who means to shoot you is a completely different question from shooting someone picking plants
@AsherLangton @willjohansson (and IMO gunning down plant thieves with assault rifles is way more immoral than thieving some stupid plants)
@AsherLangton @willjohansson I imagine that’d go down to the levels of generic robbery if it was fully properly legal to grow
@willjohansson … I realize they’re just trying to fit as many issues as possible into one tweet, but the result is absurd :p
@willjohansson since they’re implying marijuana being legal, which is fine, in what reality would you need to gun down pesky garden gnomes

@marcusjcarey that would be the most consistent way, you’re right.
@marcusjcarey another really good question, actually
@marcusjcarey obviously this is actually pretty complicated. But that’s why we need some better legal protections than we have now…
@marcusjcarey oh, that’s *from* the outside to the inside; I was thinking from the inside.
@yourserversdown @marcusjcarey you don’t need a “digital postal service.” Just a legal acknowledgement that it’s private communications.
@marcusjcarey work email is slightly different in that it’s the communications of the company itself, so the company can look at it
@grp well what else would you expect to find when breaking into a lawyer’s email?
@marcusjcarey of course! Just because it’s technologically easy to sneak a peek doesn’t mean it’s ethical.
If the American APT didn’t “see any privileged communications,” that’s primarily because they casually redefine email to be non-private.

@JackLScanlan @dresdencodak my gods never before have I wanted a Nintendo plot to be handed over to an outsider
@bSr43 while you’re there, may I have an option to export the asm without the address columns etc. so it’s “valid”? Pretty please &lt;3
@jyrow5 it can handle four color mode used in dual GB/GBC mode but not full color
@jyrow5 it contains in it all the Gameboy hardware (except the screen) and plugs into a Super Nintendo
I cannot tell you how much it pleases me that the Zapper still makes the exact same sproing sound after a lifetime.
@grayj_ that’s what he — sorry.
It's a Gameboy... with no batteries... and TV-out... and SNES controllers... http://t.co/WRhpsKpO3S
@entityreborn that's covered under smartphone ;)
@RSWestmoreland what did you do to yours, throw it off a bridge?

@m1sp @jesster_king you misunderstand me: a *correct* touch interface uses the pixels it has to scale to intended size clearly as possible
@jesster_king resolution only affects how *clear* the image is on a mobile interface. Physical size of elements matters.
@bSr43 *nudge* hai! On Windows it is segfaulting when I try to export the .asm :(
@jesster_king the tweet about ahh the shampoo is arranged neatly ahh

@The1TrueSean @apiary @codeferret_ also you forgot to do the math of how long it takes to paint thousands of pixels vs. playing video games

@The1TrueSean @apiary &gt;steady hand  &gt; steady  &gt; *trip*
Ooh a Nintendo controller bed set — it’s *painted*? Sorry I am not responsible enough to take care of painted pillows
@apiary I found someone on etsy who will paint pixel art on the face of furniture for $300 I think that would be really neato

@jeremywsherman it’s a book. It uses three different A’s and an ‘a’ on one page

@mister_borogove @m1sp obviously a weather forecasting program isn’t conscious, but I consider that a human decision making tool
@mister_borogove @m1sp the implication that some political parties are less conscious was not intentional.
@killerswan @mammothhq perhaps in the mind of whoever called it Pinterest for men - it wasn’t corporate marketing, just some guy.
@mister_borogove @m1sp I’m a fish, I’ll eat this -&gt; I’m a squirrel, I’ll stockpile this -&gt; I’m a human, let’s talk sustainability
@mister_borogove @m1sp I define consciousness as a gradient proportionate to the ability to make decisions without immediate results
@jpgoldberg ethics is hard :(
@m1sp @eevee … and it turns out that’s fairly common but people are terrified to admit it.
@m1sp @eevee … I may have told six thousand followers about my mechanical difficulties consummating my marriage, recently…
@eevee @m1sp I’ve found success freely intermixing personal and technical tweets, few mind and many enjoy if you’re sincere.
@m1sp @mister_borogove just run it in Dwarf Fortress
@m1sp but it means we all learn by conditioning to never look straight up because it hurts. Strange existence.
@m1sp though I find it strange to think that our eyes are incapable of directly examining something that’s in the sky *every day*
@m1sp imagine if we didn’t have long periods of darkness at regular intervals that caused us to go into suspended animation all the time
@eevee not to inflate your ego twice in one night but I practically have that thing hotkeyed to send to young programmers
@m1sp this is going to sound really sappy but you getting on twitter late in the evening is the second sunrise of my day

@C0deH4cker in the context of “film” specifically, that doesn’t matter much. Actors always do weird things to get it filmed right.

@AndreaJessup the fact that there exist people who never reach mental and emotional adulthood is a sad reality of our fragile flesh.
“My philosophy is more complex than you just described!” “So is Pokémon, but you don’t need a degree in it to know it’s pretend” ht @pzmyers
.@eevee is a wise man and I won’t RT his entire commentary on making jokes at others’ expense and being surprised they’re upset.
@ErrataRob cash out, quick…
@seabre that sounds less … reasonable …
@seabre makes sense; forcing a mentally disabled person to go cold turkey and face withdrawal, in the hospital, sounds like a terrible idea
@williampietri … and children’s TV stations, who are in it to make a killing, won’t even depict cigarettes. So that’s pretty low.
@williampietri preying on the mentally incapacitated is one of the few things more wicked than preying on the ignorance of children imo…
@JastrzebskiJ like, when you see an obese child- not overweight, but *obese*- either it’s a medical condition or their parents need slapping
@JastrzebskiJ as disabled as he appears to be? Yes… because it’s someone else failing to responsible wrt him.
@puellavulnerata @PalantirTech … that’s some misleading marketing if I ever heard it.
… like, he’s an adult, he can smoke, but if he’s 8yo on the inside, isn’t the right thing to do to keep an eye on his consumption?
There’s a very mentally disabled man who lives here who smokes too much. I wonder if he understands the risk, and if not, who enables it…

@WarOnPrivacy You know Windows 8 runs everything Windows 7 runs right? It just also has this gaudy other thing.
@MalwareJake in the case of the VPN client it's clearly Cisco's fault. "Disable driver signing"
@MalwareJake I'm reasonably sure it's Cisco's bug. MS has taken a harder line on not breaking their implementation for others' ease.
It just now occurs to me that *both* Cisco VPN and Cisco corporate WiFi routers do not work with Windows 8. For goodness sake!
That's why humans rock - we are compelled to share things that our brain liked.
I find it fascinating how, when a person encounters something they think is neat  or clever, they feel compelled to share it - with anyone.

If my Mac is connected to a VPN, and my tablet is internetting over the Mac by Bluetooth, why can't the tablet reach hosts through the VPN

@RSWestmoreland 4yo not related to the sheriff. It was a picnic at someone’s house. Could be anyone’s kid I guess
@cgiffard Recovering the seed from the token would be big news. They’re designed to wipe themselves if you break the seal.
@cgiffard you start by emailing an attachment to RSA…
@rantyben I don’t always get foreign words off the internet, but when I do, I get them from hateful wicked trolls
@tenfootfangs is this a trick to get my question mark ratio even higher?
@tenfootfangs are we using the Socratic Method?
Are as many of my tweets questions as @abby_ebooks would imply?
@chriseng @abby_ebooks now the question is if whoever scours Twitter for veracode mentions will think I'm off my rocker
@torvos I'm sure that's mentioned at some point, and possibly by a cop because cops are "cool" to 7yos, but it's not a necessity.
@torvos school resource officer is a polite way of saying a cop whose beat is the local schools. Not really a fan...
@torvos ... I know we have a reputation for liking guns, but we don't teach shooting in schools...
@leethax0r one of them was a cop. That’s both reason to have a loaded weapon and reason to have way better common safety sense
You wanna own a gun? Okay sure. First question: are you responsible enough to keep a 4yo from picking up a loaded gun right in front of you
Adults pull out their big-kid bang bang toys to show off. In the same room as a small child. Someone dies. http://t.co/TTYAwEPtYb
@janl well that’s good because the concept sounds interesting but I am so not buying another Mac to serve JavaScript ;)
I’m glad the article on Shodan ( http://t.co/rYA1j07sec) doesn’t paint it as a terr’rist commie hacker thing
@nullwhale apparently you can manually browse to the gold server and use the SSL without gold. They just don’t advertise the fact.
Charging extra for SSL is like charging extra for food that meets health and safety requirements. @BoxHQ also does this I think…
@spacerog that’s more of a movie plot than something they’d ever do in this political climate don’t you think
@leastfixedpoint @zooko … this is the first time I’ve ever seen a web framework that “only runs on OSX.” Like really.
@miniBill thank you for the link, but this happened a while ago and I already laughed at them hahaha :)
@_yossi_ it’s a joke. I’m “twelve”, but I just had a birthday!
@hackerfantastic I didn’t mean to imply it’s totally okay. Just that China is not going to demand your extradition…
@hackerfantastic there are way more malware operations going on in shady countries than there is law enforcement prepared to deal with it…
@TehOhJay I’m not particularly worried about FEMA and USPS :)
Oh hello, three letter agency social media surveillance crews. I haven’t messed with any C&amp;C servers in any country. Since I turned 18.
@TimBiden not me *personally*…
Messing with C&amp;C servers in China is at the top of the list of fun things that are technically crimes that you’ll never get in trouble for
@selenamarie nah. DRM. It’s a real racket.
@apeiros until there was *money* in it, at which point it was taken away…
@apeiros Essentially, the principles of equality have won, but we have decades of mop-up ahead of us to clean millennia of grime!
@apeiros it is, at least, a lot better than it used to be, and getting better; as ever there are always a few who need to be dragged along
@wimremes @andreasdotorg we have really cute internal tools I wish I could show off :(
@andreasdotorg not me personally but it seems @weldpond is every time I turn around
@andreasdotorg it’s very automated. But you get a report of vulns, not the decomp itself, no one external gets those
@fearthecowboy @Future_Garrett @hypatiadotca +1 for actually registering the account first!
@andreasdotorg nah… we really do essentially have “decompiliation as a service”
@andreasdotorg @justdionysus we offer Better Dataflow Analysis Than Yours… In The Cloud
@justdionysus … or you can come work for us and use our toys
@justdionysus I used computer crayons http://t.co/l6DOzKvYIi
@justdionysus dude didn’t you see my chart? Get out some crayons and start coloring registers
@docsmooth @0xcharlie I’m just saying, the original context was teens
@0xcharlie aren’t your kids like, five years old though
@0xcharlie elite haxorz tend not to obsessively stifle their children. I hope.
@cji did your shoes just tweet at me
“70% of teens actively seek to hide their online behavior from their parents.” The other 30% are victims of forced Facebook friending
@Worthless_Bums @Tomi_Tapio you like music, he likes music, it’s meant to be :p
@Packetknife I’m just sitting over here like: I’m an American and what is this 🇺🇸
@Viss if your huge spike lasts more than four hours, consult with your doctor
If your reaction to a foreigner getting pulled over for speeding is “he should be thankful the cops didn’t &lt;ridiculous overreaction&gt;”…
@alongland @i0n1c I would not wish a confrontation with American cops on anyone :(
“Artistry in every sip” I may be the kind of person who buys Starbucks, but this marketing needs to tone it down a notch
@apeiros @whitequark 'twas in fact the very man who presumes to claim he is my husband !
@jesster_king it's still noodles and rice but like, different recipes. Tastes healthier
The Thai food stand made fun of me for changing up my usual order... so I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious
@chriseng nope! DH is screwed.
@m1sp that would be a twist ending...
@Unwitnessed I'm married to T; his best friend is G; T just called me G-&gt;Wife
Guess who just called me by his best friend's wife's name, in front of his best friend
@hypatiadotca in the car, I just now realize I suddenly departed
@unixronin she doesn’t have one lol
@maradydd I can’t stand him but I support his human right to share his writings so I wouldn’t “blame” you.
@ra6bit meta-irony is what I will be remembered for
@unixronin that’s not how twitter works…
Which is more dignified: to text my mother “stop reading my twitter” or just not answer
@blowdart good, because it was tongue-in-cheek
Two datapoints: Ida Pro and (Grace) Hopper.app. That's a trend: disassemblers are ladies.

.@ebcube notice whether I criticize being barbaric or civilized depends totally on whichever lets me be lazier
@ebcube or I could just automate it like a civilized person!
@JastrzebskiJ yes, like so
Needed: for my browser to detect me typing, eg, !xkcd:theoneaboutstandardsproliferation and fill in the URL as appropriate
@mof18202 yup.

@zooko just saying, the internet isn’t as full of stupid, ignorant people as it first appears. Many participants are still in beta.
Dear newscaster: you say: “we’ve lost a great Briton” I hear: you lost an entire island and change. How did you manage that
@thegrugq I’m thirteen now!
@m1sp and it certainly does not sound unmistakably feminine to my ears!
@m1sp “Margaret” is a name that has almost vanished from America. They’re probably 11yos who have never heard the word.
Internet discussions strip most of the context of who is participating, which is both amazing and confusing.
Super awesome android boot loader hacking by @djrbliss http://t.co/Ae6IplGLPn
@rubbsdecvik I’m just saying, if you get into an argument with an 11yo and are baffled by how “stupid” they are, you’re being foolish ;)
@blowdart 13.
@ereslibre not that they’re usually eleven but that they usually COULD be eleven; they’re well-mixed and often inconspicuous.
@rubbsdecvik there’s a big difference between correcting an 11yo and treating them like a particularly ignorant 30yo.
Anytime you’re upset with someone on the internet, stop and ask yourself: could this person be eleven years old? The answer is usually yes.
Now to brace for the wave of old people angry that eleven-year-olds on the internet haven’t heard of a famous old person who passed away.
@rantyben *backs away slowly*
@JoelEsler @iseezeroday … I feel like putting this on the internet isn’t fair to this kid in the long term…

Whoa, I hadn't seen New Housemate in about two years, and he... grew into his facial features I guess?
@rubbingalcohol @matthew_d_green it's been fixed I guess. A javascript injection vector.
@locks just making fun of megatokyo :)
@flyhachi THEY CALL ME... HEIR OF THE MAYFLOWER
@flyhachi then you were born about 0 miles from where my dad was born probably :p
@joshrossi because coins can be permanently lost and there's a finite amount; I'm not an economist though.
@joshrossi I think I wish I had generated some when it was really easy, but long term it will fall apart
@K_DAN_Jr thank you, trying to catch up after neglecting developing my abilities for a while...

#sketch this is probably the best thing I have ever drawn... in pen, because I ran out of pencils http://t.co/fH5dDC1r2f
@elwoz sure, I guess, if you swear not to leak or that villainess shall claim your soul with a giggle.
@elwoz yup... more than half done, finally...
@Abablabab http://t.co/MKUjr1a2pn
@Raxphiel redheads or sword-wielding maniacs?
@m1sp also if you get on chat I will share some really creepy Plot with you
@m1sp I ended up incorporating it as a gag into the script.
@Tomi_Tapio I do a lot of sketches with more dynamic stuff, but I never have the patience to make them polished. http://t.co/NnULRWTa8F
I bet him and New Housemate pulled over and are having cuddles! Manly straight cuddles
He left Virginia ten hours ago and I haven’t heard a peep since… not answering his phone… I know it’s on, he can’t get anywhere without GPS!
@elwoz (she is a Dastardly Villain in my novel)
@elwoz well what kind of girl goes out without her sword
@codinghorror I have like a 30% on a link I posted last night, I suspect you have a very high ratio of dead account followers.

@m1sp I just accidentally drew some lovely feminine geographic features on young!Rashk because I drew him too pretty
@eqe their god invented refrigeration specifically so banning things due to ease of food poisoning was no longer necessary !
@tapbot_paul noscript, I guess...
@RSWestmoreland oh, um. I find it kind of odd everyone else is casually suggesting I not wear clothes in front of a man I'm not atrracted to
What about zooplankton? They're animals... (I don't actually dislike vegans, just definition trolling)
@bmirvine everything that's ever been exposed to air can contain insect parts!
@KrakensDen honestly I don't know but all soil kind of has decomposed animal matter in it somewhere don't you think!
@homologygroup without having triggered it myself, it appears to be getting malicious javascript onto the oauth page.
Apparently figs aren't vegan to some because they tend to contain insect parts. Pretty sure at that point nothing can ever be vegan
@tapbot_paul (where "just worked" == it auto-propels you through oauth and adds the app)
@tapbot_paul I'm not sure, but one of my followers reported that, with javascript on, they went to the site and it just worked
@thequux ... you're CFG-sexual?
@TinyPirate @Tomi_Tapio I generally don't play online games that only have (clearly) male avatars; I get misgendered enough with *this* av!
Twitter has deleted the tweets known to contain the malicious link, but is the underlying vuln fixed yet? /cc @mikko
@RSWestmoreland there's a third signature line on the paperwork waiting for him
@sakjur yeah; start with 32-bit.
@Voulnet check @mikko's feed.
@snrson well, he's a straight male, so.....,
The long-promised housemate is arriving today. Dangit, I have to start wearing pants in my own house like some kind of civilized person
@inversephase I’m not sure what else you could have possibly expected!
I’m going to commit a minor sin and timezone-repost my color coded disasm data flow chart because I think it’s cute  http://t.co/l6DOzKvYIi

@davidjayharris I would definitely avoid ones that are double-wrapped in shorteners so you can’t see where they really go
@NoMoreCloset @panther_modern they can add an arbitrary app to your account and start tweeting as you.
@panther_modern I RT’d some things of @mikko
@miaubiz no it’s not
@nullwhale also anyone can reimplement the exploit on a new domain
@nullwhale I’m pretty sure it didn’t start out with that.
Apparently it *is* true, there’s an exploit for sending you through Twitter’s oauth automatically, and it still works, be paranoid.
@nullwhale oh, well, obviously noscript doesn’t count.
@snare I hesitate to even ask what prompted that remark
@nullwhale implying your first tweet was mistaken?
@mirell start with 32-bit for sure and honestly at this point I don’t even remember how I got started
I just woke up. There’s an actual twitter worm? As in you click the link and it just adds the app?
@TinyPirate @Tomi_Tapio — then I saw female avatars but by that time I just had kind of a slightly icky feeling about the community
@TinyPirate @Tomi_Tapio first time I saw Day Z I decided not to play bc it appeared there was only male avatars (1/2)
@oh_rodr I assume you mean weev who I blocked something like a year ago. But you know he mails his tweets to a friend right?
@mirell it’s largely a matter of knowing how to write assembly first. Then write some C and look at the disassembly.
@sakjur at EntryPoint!…. Or is that not what you’re asking
@jesster_king lol I think you might have missed the dripping sarcasm :p
Why does this site default to birthyear 1995? Children shouldn't -- -- -- -- oh my gods
@geekable I knew what that was without even hovering the URL...
@therulerofchina (in general, KJV is an outright irresponsible translation, including politically motivated decisions)
@therulerofchina that's a translation quirk.
@edropple actually you can see their definition of India here on this map, waaaay on the edge :) http://t.co/7T5OV6NaN8
@edropple (granted their definition of India probably does not match the modern boundary)
@edropple it is mentioned explicitly in the first sentence as the far boundary of the Persian empire.
Another little-known fact is that India is mentioned in the Bible - in the book of Esther. Geographically speaking it's pretty inclusive
It's said there are no "white" people in the Bible but that's actually not true. Aside from the Greeks and Romans, the Galatians are Celtic.
@tylerbindon I suspect it's more of a covering thing if someone gets sick after undercooking it.
This microwave chicken pie box wants me to check with a thermometer for 163 degrees throughout. Chicken pie, you're just not that special
@McGrewSecurity I enjoy scribbling on things in general but the graph doesn't have enough annotations (ie it doesn't show the format string)
